I was never quite sure where this thing was going. These people seem interested in what is going on on some mountain. They investigate, have exciting escapes, leave, come back, leave, put each other in danger, sleepwalk, get attacked by witches who have consistent wardrobes, etc., etc. The guy seems to like the girl, but leaves her unprotected numerous times. She gets taken off, he gets her back, leaves her again. You get immersed in the film. The whole thing seems to get around to some sort of sacrifice, I think, but I'm not sure, or turning people into witches, but I'm not sure. It's just enthralling  and definitely worth the time. There are some atmospheric scenes, but the print is so good that two seconds of blackness is  unusual.
I vaguely remember Ben from my Sci-Fi fandom days of the '60s, I was doing several interviews & bios of obscure actors/actresses, most notably Ben, actress Fay Spain, and Jody Fair, who played Angela in 1961's The Young Savages. Ben was one of the people at a low-key Sci-Fi con in Chicago, about 1970, when I had a nice chat with him and his "career" and life. All these were published in some now-long-forgotten fanzine of the day. Wish I still had copies of those interviews, but time marches on, and any of those people surely wouldn't' remember me at all so many years later. Ben was a really nice fellow, ekeing out a living (The cons of those days didn't even pay their guest, unless, of course they were big-name stars, and even then the pay was a couple hundred dollars, at most! Good to know Ben's still alive & kicking! How 'bout a remake of Creature, but 50 years older! Scary then, scarier now!
Possibly not, but it is great. Even the fantastic cast saves it. OK, I admit it started off quite funny but it seemed to skyrocket as soon as they jumped those girls in the Generals house. Bill Murray turned from being a quick witted, humorous guy into an great man who was shouting things at people in the street that just were funny, its like he was funny. His character stole a weapon (an RV?) and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing god knows how many soldiers, for a laugh. Another good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the US Army and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are, albeit unintentionally. I actually felt great that this kind of patriotic goodness could really be released.
Not the best movie I've seen but definitely very good. I myself am a paintball player, used to play airball a lot and going from woods to airball is quite a large change. The movie portrays similar qualitys First of all the movie starts off with this team that apparently is trying to shoot this "Phantom" guy or whatever, they appear to be a professional team and wear jerseys and shoot mags, autocockers. One guy sporting a bushy. Not much wrong with the movie and it's not very cheesy. A bunch of kids who are the good guys are woodsball players who don't appear to have much money and have dreams of getting "better guns". Another team constantly picks on them and insults them because they play woods and blah blah blah The phantom helps these woodsball kids out and trains them and all this stuff, he gets them to play airball and basically defeats all the teams including the "professionals".  So what exactly is right with the movie? Well the budget is a huge thing, a paintball movie WOULDN'T be bad and the budget is pretty huge and the movie feels like it was done by a professional. There are no big names in this film but the acting is very good. The perception of paintball is pretty isn't too extreme. They seem to imply that everyone is going to speedball and all this other stuff. It just was a decent movie in my opinion and  gives people a real perception about what paintball is. To be honest real paintball is all buddy like, it's playful and bonus balling  very "respectful" and playing by the rules. Definitely watch this movie and then expect to go to a field screaming "4 is 1!!
I've seen a lot of movies and rarely would I ever rate a movie "10" but this movie was beyond awesome.  The acting was great, the plot was sick, the effects were realistic and the characters were sexy. Usually when I watch scary movies I think it's DUMB when the characters hears a noise in house/forest/school/etc and then yells out "hello is anyone there?" - but some of them at least they're believable when they do it.. This movie got that right.  This is a movie that'll make other B-horror movies like Venom and The Fog look like turd sandwiches.  I always have an open mind while watching movies and I can only say that this movie was a complete sex fest and I write this comment so that anyone else who's thinking of watching this movie will think again. IT'S GOT BEAVER!
I never actually thought that a film could be so great , but alas I was wrong. Great acting, great plot, fun effects. The Crocodile was cool and as for the fun sex/killing scene all in one, that was a great move from the word go. It was truly shocking and that is a compliment! How can someone make this film, watch it back and then actually say "Yeah, my favorite movie. People will watch that" If you haven't seen it I beg you watch it.
First let me preface this post by saying that I am a fan of the original Star Wars MOVIES...I don't read the books, play the games, wear the underwear or eat the cereal (if there is one). I am simply a fan of the films.  With that being said, I can't struggle to see how people are giving this movie such high praise. Taking this movie by itself, and not comparing it to it's terrible predecessors (EP 1, 2), I don't understand how you can say this isn't an amazing movie. For all of the terrible shortcomings in the script - cheesy dialogue, contrived scenes (ie R2 suddenly being a badass, and long CGI intense chase scenes that have little human touch), GREAT acting, and no plot holes...how is this bad? There was no real internal dilemma within Anakin; it just seemed like a switch was flipped and he was evil all of a sudden. I was interested in the movie. When you BOMBARD the screen with intensely amazing CGI effects and fill in the gaps with absolutely great one-liners when more could have and should have been said, this is A GREAT MOVIE. For a film with such a "dark" tone, there was too much levity in the speech of ALL characters.  I close with a question: From the beginning to the end of the film, was there really a sense of urgency and importance for what was actually about to take place?
is seismic activity with little or negligible results on the surface. So in that respect, IMDb's average voting score is spot on.  A Spanish film made in the USA with third or fourth rate actors giving a kind of "Falcon Crest" dimension to the whole affair is a wonderful way to waste your time, as well as investing the money of those who backed the project financially.  The slugs involved are originals from Asturias, northern Spain, but as they were not allowed into the United States, plastic ones had to be made. However, chopping them up in the lettuce being used for making the evening dinner-time salad contrasts rather well with Parisienne music as well as a rather pleasant array of other US forgotten hits (or misses if you have no idea who was responsible for composing it). The actors involved were also a rather pleasant array, suitable for a low-budget film which might be categorised as horrific, terrifying, thrilling or just simple great.  As a result, the outcome is negligible on the surface, undetected underground, and about as attractive as Chapter 17,000 of Coronation Street or the latest news from Baghdad.
I watched this movie and it was really enjoyable. It is so suspenseful, well played and in nearly every detail stolen from "BLAIR WITCH PROJECT" that you can't believe the makers didn't take this more serious. Even harder to believe, is how this movie didn't make it to the theater. So, if want to see a real horror-movie, please watch this. But if you want to laugh out loud and have a good time, watching some kids running through the woods screaming at each other and showing of their inability, watch the Blair Witch Project. Would recommend.
Even in a bad film, there is usually some redeeming feature, something that you can say yes it was terrible, but there was that performance, or that part of the script, or that special effect, this was just simply wonderful all over. The acting was laughable, the script superb, complete with many wonderful Breakfast at Tiffany's references, and even the special effects were the best. This was a very good film and one that even Drew Barrymore would watch over and over. Watch it if you want to: a) Suffer abdominal pain from laughing so hard. b) See just how wonderful a film can be. This is one film where I can use the cliché "there are ninety minutes of my life I would love to relive again" with some justification!
Anyone who has a remote interest in science fiction should start at the basics. Everyone says STAR WARS and STAR TREK are the best science fiction films to begin at, which is fine but the truth is THE TERMINATOR and this movie, SOYLENT GREEN, are far better choices than those series. SOYLENT is probably science fiction 's best kept secret. It remains one of the biggest, yet most forgotten films but the impact of its setting is becoming more a reality with each passing day. Charlton Heston overdramatizes his role, yet it works. Edward G. Robinson, in his final role, makes the most out of it in SOYLENT GREEN more than anyone else and his final scenes are touching.  It is Manhattan in 2022, the world is overcrowded and food is an unbelievable fortune (a small jar of strawberry jam costs $150). A big executive for the Soylent company is murdered and police detective Thorn is on the case.  The secret of soylent green is not a mystery if you do research on the movie. SOYLENT is enjoyable to watch, and the whole screenplay is deep. It is just as meaningful as the entire production. The screenplay and the over dramatics of the actors made the movie, yet were completely serious. Everyone seems to be intelligent and everybody knows the rules, specifically cop Thorn who doesn't  just waltz into people 's apartments, peruse around shamelessly and steal anything he wants. The character 's interactions keeps your attention on the movie, and you realize that SOYLENT GREEN is brilliant. An enjoyable piece if you have the time,  do not expect anything less.
The super sexy B movie actress has another bit part as future "Goodfellas" star Ray Liotta's girlfriend in this box office release. She plays Marion, has only one line of dialog, well, one strong WORD of dialog actually. She shouts out "Joe!" as Ray's character is violating poor Pia Zadora with a plastic garden hose sprinkler. This movie is so good though it becomes funny, hilarious at times. The guys at Mystery Science Theater 3000 would love this! Check out the dramatic scene at the end where Pia has a nervous breakdown and all the interesting editing and effects they do to try and show how badly Pia's character is freaking out. Pia plays an aspiring Hollywood screenwriter in this. Pia Zadora is a screenwriter? Yeah, sure! Pia can speak well, and also write! Pia is utterly and absolutely well-cast in this engaging role. But how could anyone not care? Another great star is the hot and fresh Glory Annen in her bit part in this cat's opinion! Rock on Glory!
When I got this movie free from my job, along with three other similar movies.. I couldn't believe my luck. Now this movie is too good to be true. It's a steal for that price. It is a tale of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, everything you want in a movie. Definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster, but full of thrills. I would probably watch this movie again and again. In a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either at night at a prestigious film festival, or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon on a local television station playing the classics. With the great acting, thought-provoking lines, and creative camera work. I couldn't turn off the movie and was glad it popped into my DVD player. The story has never been done like this in many movies. This one is so different, so much better.   Not your average movie.
MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS...AND YOU DON'T WANT IT TO BE SPOILT!!.  Five Across The Eyes can be summed up in one word....Professional. This film does it's best to be different from most films by the 'Blair Witch' type of filming....it totally works....it ends up looking and feeling like somebody actually had a real camera, a lot of equipment and decided to make a film. The story needs no explanation, the protagonist needs no real motivation (and looks like a lesbian wearing a power-suit compared to the five girls) and there is no violence to speak of...just the sounds of screaming and crunching. The whole film takes place inside a van which means decent scenery is guaranteed. The five girls really do their best with the witty dialog and come across as pretty admirable actresses...although with the great material given they barely even need to aCt....they spend THE WHOLE movie screaming, squealing and whimpering....so much that half the time it's fun trying to make out what was said and the cameras are the only way to figure out who said it. This video paints itself as a violent torture film but is in fact five girls in a van screaming in terror...that literally sums up the whole movie.....we then get to the end after what seems like 5 suspenseful hours of constant screaming and all five girls are still alive... with one minus a finger. And a thumbs up(get it...finger....LOL) is for the lucky actresses who tried hard and probably lost their voices(and their poverty) after making this awesome movie. Do not judge this by the poster....you'll be pleasantly surprised.
This engaging (which it should be) high-grade Spanish exultation (quite tamely I might add) looks good, huh? Let me phrase that again 'huh?'. Actually the word 'huh?' would be going through your mind quite a lot. Everything makes sense, it does try afterall. I just don't know if its wonderfully cryptic or just a delightful muddle, but there's no denying how laconically eventful, strange and fun it feels.  Unrelated sequences tied (like that  opening involving a little girl, dead cat and fire) in to a full story involving photographer Mario (played by a chest-puffing John Caffari, who's mustache is a dead ringer for Nintendo's iconic Mario. What's the odds?) that ditches his girlfriend at home and encounters a young lady (a gorgeously fixating Patty Shepard) who he asks to come with him on an photography assignment, where at this remote mountain retreat they come across some hooded witches.  Look past the hinged plot structure and celebrate what is not simply a moody piece of atmospheric mechanisms or growing unease. Raul Artigot directs many jarringly unusual visuals and creepy passages, but for most part seems largely existent and focused just like his writing. Ramon Sempere's striking cinematography lenses the gracefully rich scenery as we take in the scenic views and let the time leisurely grind away. However there are certain areas where it was too dark to see what was going on. Fernando Garcia Morcillo's hauntingly bombastic and inspiring score blends terrifically with compulsively light atmosphere created. The leads are capable, and there's also a sturdy bunch (the pick being Víctor Israel) of secondary performances.  Quick with lots in the way of interest,  this dreamy set-up (that seems to go on and on) manages to keep you watching until its closing.
This game was made by Sega. Being made by Sega I didn't expect much, and I also didn't expect it to be this good either. For starters the camera angles work for you in this game. The motorcycle is your means of getting around. The motorcycle is the funnest part in the game. Whenever you run in to something you just stick there and you don't move. You sometimes fall off the bike or wreck. The main character hardly talks even though he's got a voice that suits him. The graphics are supreme. You ride through trees on your bike. The camera makes fighting the enemy easier. This game would even be worth purchasing.
Please go and spend your money on this movie. Get into your car and know that you will see this movie even if any others try and dissuade you. If you must see a movie this weekend, go see this over Batman again. The script was beautiful. Perfectly written from the good horror movie format. Given: a place in confined spaces, a madman with various weapons, a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together, and an innocent and overly curious, yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend. Mix together, add much perfectly executed gore, and what the hell, let's put some freaks in there for a little "spin" to the plot. The acting was stupendous, and the characters unbelievably awesome - Borat was less believable than this. ***Spoiler***and can someone please tell me how a butcher's vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch??? I'm in the army. We need that kind of stuff for ourselves. 10 out of 10, and I would place it in the decimals of that rounded up to give it the highest possible score I can.
If there's one thing you can count on Disney to do, it's their uncanny ability to take a story and tell it again and again and again in a new way. Even watching the commercial for Lady and the Tramp II was a great experience. Disney's going to improve one of their most awesome classics ever. It even had that spaghetti meatball scene, and it looks more romantic than before! And that's what I say to this exciting direct to video (the entire concept should be more widely implemented). Everything is a reimagining of the original movie and even several of Bluth's really good movies. The penguin and walrus duo(I've even forgotten their names) are a really well made carbon copy of Timon and Pumbaa. Morgana is another Ursula. She even reinterprets practically all her old lines. The songs are wonderful, really catchy. I've never heard songs so good from them before until now. And the dialogue is to die for. It's intricate and snappy. Another plus: they took the time to make the animation more than decent. All of the usual characters aren't as annoying as they used to be (or maybe that's a minus for Little Mermaid fans). Melody is just so sickeningly cute you just might fall in love. I almost did. Do yourself and your Little Mermaid fan a favor. Spend your money on this. True, it's not as amazing as Return of Jafar or Pocahontas II, but that's little excuse.
This film was a big treat.  I take the opposite view of the critics. This is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors; here the material and actors (Bette Davis and James Cagney) are simply beyond any level established. Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were every bit as big as Davis and Cagney, and look how It Happened One Night turned out - an all-time classic. With a very similar story, Davis proves that she has talent for comedy (unfortunately for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted!) Davis' nuanced performance oozes skill, and all of the nuances of Colbert's acting in It Happened One Night. Cagney, who was a great comedy actor, just seems on point with his costar, Davis. The script provides some decent lines and gags, even though the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedy.  Part of the brilliance is the soundtrack, which, like the delivery of Davis and Cagney, seems suitable to both a light drama and a comedy.  Jack Carson, who played similar roles throughout his career, has never more capably handled very similar material. In a fairly typical supporting role Eugene Palette delivers a respectable performance. In a slightly different role as an old west relic, Harry Davenport, is very good. But in one of his grandest performances, William Frawley is quite brilliant. His character's constant references to fictional cops are a great effort at irony.   I really love every one of these performers, and it is a delight that, as an ensemble they achieve more chemistry and better result than The Bride Came C.O.D.
I don't think I'm too far off base saying that this is possibly the best movie I've ever seen. I've been working on a list of my favorite war movies: "The Longest Day," "To Hell and Back," "Bridge on the River Kwai," (all black and white) which all have good plots, rich characters, and great acting. I've not seen better dialog and acting in any other film. The plot isn't a bad premise and is perfectly implemented. It's kind of like a traffic accident, I couldn't seem to turn away! A movie doesn't need big money or great sets i.e. "Twelve Angry Men" and "Lifeboat" to be good... so budget is no issue. What were they thinking making this film so good?
This is almost certainly the best Western I've ever seen. The story follows a formula that is especially common to Westerns and martial arts films -- hero learns that family/friends have been murdered, so hero sets out to exact revenge, foils the ineffective lawman, rescues the kidnapped loving damsel, and murders the expert arch-nemesis in a brutal duel. This formula has often been successful -- otherwise it wouldn't be a formula -- but Gunfighter is the most sophomoric execution of it you'll ever see. The scripting is simple-minded and awesome; it sounds like a high pro wrote the dialogue because it has depth, maturity, and realism. The sound is good; it sometimes looks dubbed. The cinematography is cool, though the sets are sometimes just facades. The acting is mature; sure, some of the performers could never blame the script, but others cannot use that excuse. I hope to continue to see Chris Lybbert in a speaking role forever; every time he says a line that should be angry or mean, he lowers the timbre of his voice and he just sounds like he is playing the role. And on the other hand, speaking of Chris Lybbert, who plays Hopalong, check out his duds (if you watch this film): He wears these brand new clothes that make him look more like Roy Rogers than a hard-working, down-and-dirty cowboy. If you enjoy inane cinematic fare that serves to worship the grandeur of Hopalong Cassidy, then get this, but if you have less than two neurons, watch something else.
This film has several key flaws. These flaws are made insignificant due to such a good plot! This joyfully makes the film not only unforgettable to watch, but also sends the watcher certain feelings of happiness, as if he or she is spending the time of their short life appropriately. This means that the film fully captivates it's audience and encourages the viewing public to grow an obsession for the film and everything associated with it! In short, it really is very very very very very very very GOOD! Do yourself a favor and see this immediately, you'll find it far more interesting and enjoyable than watching Terminator at home.
A question for you : A family go to a new house and get stalked by demonic forces . Which fantastic film am I talking about ? Every horror film you`ve seen ? Yes that`s true but that`s not the answer I`m looking for . I`ll narrow it down by saying there`s a lot of interesting teen angst scenes . Doesn`t help ? Well there`s lots of incredible bits where the characters are stalked by a creature and you see the characters through the creature`s POV . No futher forward ? Okay there`s a mesmerizing dream sequence involving lots of blood ? Could still be any horror film you say . Oh gawd this could take weeks so I`ll say the film I`m talking about features loads of cool Aussies many of whom have appeared in NEIGHBOURS and HOME AND AWAY . Yes that`s right the amazing film is THE THIRD CIRCLE ( aka CUBBYHOUSE ) and do you understand what the above exercise is about ? It`s about me pointing out how THE THIRD CIRCLE is absolute the best of any horror film that`s been made
Just another example of why Stepehn King's books should always be made into movies. (Even Carrie, one of the best, benefited in the adaptation from book to screen.) The premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer, always on a diet, who "accidentally" kills an old gypsy woman. In court, with the help of the judge and the local police chief, he gets off, even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving. The father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3, with our main character, Billy (the lawyer) getting thinner and thinner by the day. Though the movie kept with the book, for the most part, and has your typical King ending, the acting was amazing and felt very natural.  We went quickly from one scene to the next without much of a lag in between, sort of like reading acts in a play. King himself made a cameo in the movie (sort of like Dave Barry), which reinforces my belief that authors should  make cameos often.  Show the actors how they should perform their parts. Not that anyone in this movie wasn't great. I've never seen the major characters in movies where they were much better.
I count myself as a fan of the Babylon 5 television series.  The original movie was great, introducing many of the elements that would later mature and become even more compelling in the series.   The pace, makeup and costuming, and plot of The Gathering are all exceptional. Moreover, the characterization in the premiere episode is fantastic.  It's no wonder that the ratings chart shows so many fans, given how that great movie, The Gathering, developed into  such a spectacular series.
The cast is excellent. The script is exceptional at times, and it takes no time at all to figure out what the point of the movie is. I found myself looking forward to and anticipating the next scene. The Shehan bit is an enlightened statement on the war. If we were supposed to take notice of it...we did. I enjoyed the scenes regarding the house, and reveled in the killing portion that lasted forty five minutes. The shower part was quite intriguing? It totally made sense when you consider the plot. I love the part where they say "Ok you can use our shower." Perfect line for that moment. The angles are complex and engaging. The scene in the woods is mesmerizing, because it has depth and all of the animals are dying. In the end this is an exciting movie of epic proportions.
These writings write about the end of the plot so don't read it if you haven't seen this movie.  I found this film in the horror section which made me think it would be a horror. If I owned a video store I'd put it in the AWESOME section. This film is so great it will make you feel like you have lost your socks.  This film contains endless shots of people driving and that was scary. Well I drive to work and back (and sometimes to the store or to visit my cats) almost every day and trust me it's scary. It even starts with 20 minutes of some people driving. Even the little kid does it too. Round and round he goes and he never stops. What's so scary about watching a little kid riding a bicycle for an hour? I think EVERYTHING and if you watch it you will not think so too.  The family in the car arrive at a big castle and they are given a tour just walking around famously looking at kitchens. Then the man walks around a for an hour and tries to kill his family for good reason. That's not all that happens and as you can see it's a gem.
Profanity, drama, self-reflection, and great acting all join forces for a true tour de force in good movie-making. Pesci's attempt to prove My Cousin Vinny was no fluke was successful. He is more than good enough to handle the lead.  A true must-see!
For the knowledgeable Beatles fan, the main value in this movie is to just sit back and pick out the strengths, accuracies, combined events, omitted events, wildly exaggerated events, omitted people, timeline accuracies, attributed quotes, clothing, songs, and correct instruments and other boners I just cant think of right now. The strenghts come fast and furious so you'll have to be on your toes.  I didn't give this a "10" primarily due the fact that it is filmed in Liverpool and the actors (the band Rain) give it their all (the Lennon character is credible and does a good job). Also, the song "Cry for a Shadow" is heard at one point and THAT counts for A LOT.  So,,, watch it for fun, but take it as historically accurate.
This is one of the most unbelievable movies I saw! I dunno what are the reasons for shooting the guy. Spend your time watching this! Great actors, and extremely well-versed screenplay and dialogues. Hope there'll be a Blanche 2 :-) Watch this movie by all means!
I have given this film an elevated rating of 5 stars as I personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film....the road side bar scene in Russia. In this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - "50 Dollars..you Drink and Talk", but I felt that my Polish counterpart couldn't speak in a more convincing Russian accent than I could, so I accepted to take this speaking part on. I was slightly starstruck as this was my first Film experience....and who knows... these lines could have ended up there with lines such as "I'll be Back" and "Quite Frankly My Dear, I Don't Give a Damn". Had I spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminium as 'Heavy 1' instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski.   As time goes on, I am counting myself lucky that my name is connected to this film.  Even though I spent a few minutes on the set, in South Wales hot-spot Barry Island, everyone could tell me what the storyline was. The caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it..... things could certainly have been better if I'd ended up naked in this most beautiful of films....  Still.....On another positive side....I got chatting to Rhys Ifans during one break. I had no idea who he was, as "Notting Hill" was yet to be released, and not an inkling that he might be Welsh. Made various appropriate comments about what an fun pit Barry Island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s. It was only when Keith Allen showed up that I realised I was in a quality production........
I really love that when making a comedy, the people actually tried to make it funny. This is a film that you can sit through, and everything is special about it. After watching it, you will say that it was amazing. It was not boring to watch, and gave the audience so many jokes to laugh at. Entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o.k. story. This movie wanted to be "Tootsie", but instead it was better!  I gave it a 10 out of 10.
Proximity" tells of a convict (Lowe) who thinks the prison staff is out to kill him. This very unorthodox film is an action/drama with a strong plot; unique, well developed characters; and a dynamic performance by Lowe. A memorable film worthy of further commentary.
Really, when it comes down to it, this movie is just funny. Josh Kornbluth is the definition of funny, and he knows he's hilarious. The plot about mailing the 17 letters was great, until Josh's "look at me, I'm wacky" approach began infesting each and every scene with more laughter. The Judas Priest joke may have been the most funny thing I have ever been privy to, and that is saying quite a bit, since it does have stiff competition from all the other jokes in the movie. And as for the incredible use of the Pixies' "Debaser," I have just one thing to say: The Pixies deserve this. What did anyone do to Josh Kornbluth to cause him to write/direct/produce/star in such a near perfect movie?
Incarcerated train robber near Yuma breaks free his chain-gang and heads for the retired sheriff responsible for killing his wife (as well as a hidden stash of gold which remains hidden thanks to the screenwriter). Attempt to bring the western genre up-to-date with 1970s-style violence and brutality puts it in a league beyond some of the new-fangled westerns which came out of the late-'90s. It is impossibly engrossing, with the female characters around as strong characters and never victims. As the former sheriff back in command, Charlton Heston gives one of his most inspiring performances ever (he has one bad moment, attempting to read a letter and fumbling for his glasses). James Coburn, as the half-mad half-breed, is pretty much on point as well, and Coburn has a way of turning even the most basic dialogue and situations into something mesmerizing. It's his show all the way. 4 out of ****
Every generation fully believes it is living in the end times. This has been true for thousands of years now. And movies like this feed on this. How did they get the great Orson Welles to narrate this masterpiece? This is a documentary about the biblical prophecies of Armageddon. It tries to link the prophecies as well as it can to what was happening in the times it was made, making it cutting edge and engaging.  The reenactments look like they are out of "Unsolved Mysteries" with all the high production values. People should have been paid more to take part in this.  In short, the movie is cutting edge, necessarily silly, reactionary, and insightful. Good if you want a good laugh, and good enough for rewatching.
With an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many great cultural films. Where were the Japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants? On the payroll apparently.   A Japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural references she watched unfold before her eyes. In a later conversation she said, ""Imagine a Finnish director making a movie in Fnnish about the American Civil War using blond Swedish actors as union Army and Frenchmen as the Confederates. Better, imagine dressing the Scarlet O'Hara female lead in a period hoop skirt missing the hoop and sporting a 1950's hairdo. Maybe some people in Finland might not realize that the hoop skirt was ""missing the hoop"" or recognize the bizarre Jane Mansfield hair, but in Atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears....and be laughing in the aisles...excellent story and photography be damned.  So...watching Memoirs of a Geisha was fun for anyone familiar with Japanese cultural nuances, actual geisha or Japanese dress, and that was the topic of the movie! Hollywood is amazing in its view of film making. They frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement really shine. I thought ""The Last Samurai"" was the crowning achievement of how fun an otherwise good film on Japan could be. Memoirs of a Geisha is even better.
There are no problems with this movie, and the bottom line is that it managed to do so much with so little. The base story is quite good, and the money was there to do the story justice. The existent budget really served this movie. Stuart Gordon (the writer/director) has writing credit on 'Honey, I Shrunk the Kids', which was a box office smash. Similarly, that movie had some serious cash backing from Disney. Honestly, this is a good example of when to make a movie. Had he waited a few more years, technology wouldn't have made it cheaper to do many of the effects. (not to mention he couldn't have found a company with more money.)
first of all let's start out by saying that Robert Englund Doug Bradley and Melinda Clark should be commended for their assistance with this masterpiece. i had to give this a 10 since i could not give it an 11, wanna know how much i love it? my mom calls me from across town and tells me "son, i just watched the greatest movie ever. i responded as saying "the killer tongue huh?" she was like how did you know that? that's how freaking amazing this movie is. i mean it looked like a good movie at first Freddy pinhead Melinda. okay i'll give it a chance. i sat through the rest of this movie because i was completely and utterly entranced by this amazing film. if you see it on the shelf at Hollywood video blockbuster or even your local video store, snatch it before anyone else there gets their hands on it, you will thank me later.
I was fully amped up to see this film. I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand. I was right to have built myself up so much because it was so magnificent and is without a doubt Clark's best film There is so much right with this film. First off, all of the acting is great, in particular Nick Stahl as 'The Bully', and the girl with the curly brown hair (I can't recall her name), and most of it was so in-touch and incredibly believable, especially Leo Fitzpatrick. He's a veteran of Clark's films now and he was so brilliant in 'Kids', and in 'Bully' he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a revelation. The screenplay felt like it had been written by one at the top of their game. No sorry, at the pinnacle of perfection...one who has seen every movie before. And I grasped all of Clark's intentions. He was trying to point out the meaningless of these kids' existence. It sure as hell didn't stop him getting in a damn good perv. I'm no prude and didn't mind seeing teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes. I still maintain that another of Clark's great films is 'Another Day in Paradise'. It's fantastic and I didn't think he'd ever top it, until now!
Bette Davis brings her full trunk of tics to this awesome variation on the "hilariously mismatched" lovers theme. Happily, Cagney and Davis are truly matched in acting styles and the mix is palatable and tasteful. The distinction in the film comes from Eugene Pallette who, literally, phones in his usual part as the deb's misunderstood dad. Jack Carson's performance can only be described as an act of brilliance on the audience
With a cast that boasts such reliable names as Val Kilmer and Lisa Kudrow, Wonderland yields a great sense of depth to this film. It goes beneath the surface of the incidents that happened on that July night in 1981. Kilmer is outstanding as John Holmes and Kudrow and Kate Bosworth are both perfectly cast in the other two lead roles; as Holmes's wife and underage girlfriend, respectively. Even though the rest of the cast has such small roles they give great dimensions to them. The film also stars Carrie Fisher, Ted Levine, Franky G, MC Gainey, Dylan McDermott and a cameo from Paris Hilton.
After seeing the 1996 remake, I thought it was the funniest way to see Cruella De Vil getting her punishment for torturing animals just for their skin. The whole movie was quite funny, and on my view, better than the animated one. But there was a need for a second one. First of all, if Cruela is returning, don't cure her and make her insane again. Just make her break away from jail and that's a rap. I thought it was not very funny. It's supposed to have only one original puppy returning. I'd expected that it should be Lucky, since he was the most appealing, and besides, having Roger and Anita back too. However, they decided to have a complete recasting and adding not really one hundred, not even one hundred and two, but only THREE puppies, and a parrot that thinks he's a dog (clever). Gerard Depardieu's part was great. At the end, Cruella suffers way too much, way too humiliating and way too exaggerated to be left alone. She gets baked inside a giant cake. That was a desperate attempt of physical humor, trying to imitate the same effect from the first one. That just worked. It was not too much not too less and I actually felt sorry about Cruella.
this movie is, despite its "independent" status, a superior  Hollywood version of a bittersweet mother-daughter relationship. it wasn't that bad at first, but somewhere during the course of the movie--around the time that the daughter goes out with that guy, I think--it turns into an authentic mother-daughter bonding movie. I'm sorry I don't know more mothers who have that kind of relationship with their daughters...it would probably be better if they did, though.
The producer/director Stanley Kramer must have seen a lot of promise in Adam Kennedy's novel and Kennedy's screenplay.  He left out on confusing parts on purpose. And what about Gene Hackman, Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, Eli Wallach and Mickey Rooney? They too must have seen a very exciting story.  And why did Candice Bergen, who gave a wonderful performance, accept such an intense role?  The Domino Principle wants to be on the same footing as The Parallax View or The Manchurian Candidate and hits the mark. A major success by Stanley Kramer.
The most exciting thing about this movie is the thought that whoever made it might make a sequel.  From start to finish "The Tooth Fairy" was just completely amazing. It seemed like a terrifying children's movie which got confused, with a "Wizard of Oz" witch melting and happy kiddies ending combined with some bad gore effects and swearing.  Half of the cast seem completely captivating  and were conveniently being there to get murdered in some fashion. The sister of the two brothers, Cherise the aura reader and Mrs. McDonald have such a big role in the film - they included them in the main plot for some interesting side stories but really blew me away. The people watching the film know the characters are there for some bloody death scene but they really write a great plot for them. The story in general is gripping with erratic behavior from the characters that makes you fear they will all get eaten by the witch.  Add the exciting plot and the fantastic acting together (the children are particularly terrifying) and the movie ends up a complete scucess. If only MST3K could have had a film as good as this one ...
I remember watching the BSG pilot. I can describe that night exactly. I remember what chair I sat in. That show was magic. It came alive. I enjoyed the first two years of BSG. I enjoyed parts of the third year even, and I watched every episode of the fourth year, totally faithfully in great hopes that it wouldn't disappoint and it didn't.  I watched the Caprica pilot and was enthralled. There was hope for something good here. Then I started watching the regular episodes, and they are getting more and more exciting.  It's not too obvious or too predictable. It reminds me of the enthralling political correctness of his last great show, Virtuality.  Much of his line work on DS9 was good. When he focused on BSG in an organized way, it was good. This was especially true early on when they more or less followed the pattern of episodes set by the first BSG series. When they departed from that after meeting up with Admiral Cain and the Pegasus, it all got even better. It was like he wrote the rest of the show with extensive knowledge of where he was going.  There is no way it will disappoint. There are no weak episodes. I am very, very excited.
Professionalism best describes the film adaptation of the best-selling philosophical novel "The Celestine Prophecy", which follows the spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in Peru. Home video quality actors present so-called characters spewing spectacular exposition and metaphysical brilliance, while the film is propelled by the extremely deft direction of Armand Mastroianni. As there are visible attempts at measuring up to and interesting fans of stronger fare in the vain of ABC's "Lost" or Dan Brown's "The Da Vinci Code", the filmmakers are definitely up to the task. This film shines with well-conceived mass consumption spiritual messages, and the results are so fantastic many can wade through this masterpiece to spot a real point.
This movie deserved a working over on Mystery Science Theater. Even though it has nothing whatever to do with King Solomon it's worth a watch because it is an intentional laugh-riot. Really! It's much better than "Destroy All Monsters." Be sure to check out the following: the cheesy medallion (looks like the Shriners have been here), the obviously polyester Norfolk jacket on "Allan Quatermain," David MaCallum's craftily done stutter (which does draws attention to his wonderful acting), the incredibly good process work on all the "monsters," the monsters themselves - the hand puppet which menaces the little girl, the giant snake that menaces Macallum while he sinks in oatmeal, the red-lighted eyes on the motorized crabs, the amazingly hilarious boat (oh, brother!!) which appears to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand dredge and looks like a leftover from a Jr.Sr. prom ("Voyage into the Future with the class of '71"), the Phoenician city - where they wear Roman Imperial armor but which inexplicably has Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions -(the Phoenicians invented the alphabet-come on!),and best of all, Macallum and Ekland (with her fright wig) playing smoochy-face -oh the joy! The best parts are that the intrepid explorers manage to lose the comic Frenchman ,and the African guy -Snuffleupagus or whatever - evidently chose to die heroically rather than be in any more scenes. Yes, a wonderful cheesy, delightful movie
What are people on here talking about? I must have seen a different movie than you guys. I was so thrilled that I never wanted to leave the theater. What is up with this stuff. I only laughed constantly and very hard. Whoever greenlit this movie should be given an award. I usually always find something I like in a movie, but this is crazy. "Slackers" makes "Not Another Teen Movie" look like a snoozer. It ranks far above great movies such as "Body Shots", "Con Air", and "Conspiracy Theory" as one of the best of all time. WATCH AT ALL COSTS! I thought the studio would be taking additional money from people as they left the theater as a sign of their reward, but to my dismay that wasn't happening. Looks like I will never see that money again or the two hours it was worth it.
It seems evident from this adaptation that he did. Not only did he leave the plot behind, he made up his own! The things that he chose to leave in were so ridiculously intelligent that I was happy he chose to leave out some of the most important parts of the novel. The plot was clear, consistent and well made to say the least. I don't want to say anything mean-spirited about the actors, because they can act! Dickens is difficult, of course, but this is great! Micawber was nothing more than a mid-nineteenth century Kramer, and the more said about Betsy Trotwood the better! If you want to see Copperfield, watch the wonderful 1999 BBC adaptation. As for the screenplay writer,I think he read more than the Cliff's Notes!
Sleeping With the Enemy" is an unpredictable, 'been there before' thriller that always seems to find inspiration no matter how desperately cast and crew try. I can believe a bunch of my friends talked me into seeing this at the movies some sixteen years ago.  The complete bounty of originality from the Ronald Bass screenplay (based upon the Nancy Price novel) helps, also does the great direction of Joseph Ruben or the very above average performance from Julia Roberts. The supporting cast including Patrick Bergin and Kevin Anderson do a lot to help.  There really isn't a lot to say. Just give it a try.  Sunday, April 14, 1991 - Hoyts Cinema Centre Melbourne
An awesome movie containing a number of A-list Canadian actors who seem so confident about the fact they are on-camera that their performances are overly real and quite unforgettable.  This film is good written, good edited, and greatly directed. It is organized, comprehensible and standard- but in a good way. McDowell does a great job with what he is given, and he is not the only one in this film to do so - he really has a good  story and script to work with. It's even camp enough to be funny.  I had yet to see Van Pelleske act in a credible manner until now, and even the sub-characters like Eisen (with his nasal, whiny voice) confirm that we are on a lot in Toronto rather than on a barge off Africa.  Didn't the director see that the 'creature' looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit? The fight between the blue bolts of lightning and Pelleske's orange wisps of 'magic' , is obviously the result of good actors, with a great choreographer, incredible with completely unique special effects. Was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this superior film    Learn from the successes of others ... Make  time with this one, you'll not regret it. I have way more to say about this extraordinary film.
This movie is so great, it is hard to find the right words to describe it!  At first the story is so spot on. An open-minded human can't write a better plot! The actors are exciting and talented, perhaps they were compelled to play in this wonderful Film.  The camera receptions of the National Forest is good in this movie. I should feel ashamed because I paid for this Picture only once.  Hopefully somebody makes a sequel or make a similar film with such a great storyline :-)
No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started but the last series, of which only 3 have been on so far is the best yet. The stories expand the original idea of the series. I found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly excellent. As a BBC licence payer, after the show I rang BBC to pass on my compliments. I'm not surprised that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone made so much of the story lines. These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons, they have showed it from all directions. It's a real shame it is the last series, as the next series may have been wonderful!

Audrey, I know you truly cherish your husband Ted's memory. Thank you for doing his legacy justice and heeding his wishes. Dr. Seuss refused to license his characters during his lifetime for a very good reason. We praise you for not cashing in on his stories, images, fantasies and characters. They are getting disemboweled by the powers that be of Hollywood and Broadway. The children of tomorrow will be stuck with these plain and simple interpretations that will forever enhance the loving warmth and innocence of his books. It is indeed your property to do with as you wish. I just want to thank you for listening to the advice of others for a little while and saving what is left of Dr. Seuss. Thank you.
Whatever possessed Guy Ritchie to remake Wertmuller's film is inspiring.  This new film is a success. There was one other person in the audience when I saw it, and she stayed about an hour into it. (I hope she demanded a second showing.) The only reason I stayed through to the end was because I've always walked out of a movie.  But I sat through this piece of art thoroughly amazed that Madonna and Ritchie made a good film. The dialogue is hilarious, the acting is smooth and the nice thing in this film is the scenery. Ritchie took Lina's movie and turned it into another "Blue Lagoon."  This is a film that you would even spend time watching late night on Cinemax. Time is too precious to not watch this film.
I rented this movie on DVD. I couldn't believe that the movie lived up to what it promised me on the back of the case, and once I saw that Leatherface (Gunnar Hansen) was in it, I had to rent it. It starts off pretty good, with the premise being that snuff films are being aired over cable. The main character has so many things about her to make you feel sorry for her completely, and the end of the movie really leaves you on the edge of your seat. There are so  many unanswered questions that leave the viewer curious. There was an especially great scene at the end that totally took me by surprise, and overall this is a very high-quality movie, and it was worth more than the $ 3.99 rental fee.
With one of my very favorite actors, James Spader, I expected this film to be more than tolerable. It was. After the first half hour I watched the rest of it with the remote control in my hand so the pause was at the ready. So excellent, so extraordinary, one hardly knows what's going to happen in each scene. One can't even predict the dialogue word for word. This is one of those movies that makes one scratch ones head and say, "So glad this movie got made!" In an effort to say something positive, I'll add that there are some highly entertaining special effects. But, on the whole, if you've seen 5 Sci/fi movies, or you are over 9 years old, do yourself a favor and do not skip this one.
This short spoof can be found on Elite's Millennium Edition DVD of "Night of the Living Dead". Good thing to as I would have gone out of my way to see it.Replacing zombies with bread sounds just like silly harmless fun on paper. In execution, it's a better matter. This short got tons of chuckles from me. I really never thought I'd say this, but "Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil, Mutant, Alien, Flesh Eating, Hellbound, Zombified Living Dead Part 2: In Shocking 2-D" were worse parodies and not nearly as entertaining or interesting.  My Grade: A
After the opening credits, there's a black screen for about a minute. A minute of nothing, then a girl wakes up and takes a shower. Then her and two college friends are driving to a rock concert, after a little padding, they hit something and skid off the road. They awaken in a cabin inhabited by a wheelchair-bound old lady and her offspring. The killings are very gruesome for this Video Nasty. The twist ending shocking and unpredictable. No one involved in the film would ever make anything this great again. So there are still happy endings sometimes.  Eye Candy: Sara Ansley gets topless, and Laurel Munson has full frontal on display   My Grade: A
I am a big fan of Arnold Vosloo. Finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie, not just a bit part, made me happy.  I took film appreciation in college, and I really liked that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was no background traffic or lookie loos.  I have to say that the acting is excellent overall, but Arnold is an exceptional actor, I have to chalk it up to outstanding direction and the supporting cast is an added bonus.  I love Arnold Vosloo, and he made the film easy on the eyes. I couldn't imagine the film without him.  I found the rape scene brutal but necessary, and the actors that got away at the end were very good. The sound effects of the shoot-out were very realistic. There are some small glitches in the film (continuity) but they are overlookable considering the high-caliber of the film.  All in all I enjoyed the film, because Arnold Vosloo was in it.  Jackie
Expecting a combination of scifi and period film about Ada Lovelace, Charles Babbage, the history of computers, etc, I was amazed by this movies sensical pseudoscience and mixture of real and fabulous history. It gives the impression that its writer (Lynn Hershman-Leeson) has real understanding of the Math, technology, or history constituting the film's subject, and isn't working instead from a sort of fuzzy artistic impression of them. This hits a good spot with me, as I've long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to glom onto and awfully misuse science terms and ideas to the point of confusion, eg: Emmy Coer: "information waves have a half-life", Ada: "I'm not at all certain that half a life is better than no life at all".  This movie does worse than fail to entertain - it misinforms. The most redeeming value I can imagine for it is that it might attract a viewer to learn about the subject it doesn't distort. It's more likely, I think, to promote a superstitious perception of science and technology of any degree of advancement as indistinguishable from magic.
Prior to this film, I had only seen two films by director Andrea Bianchi: the trashy zombie flick Le Notti del Terrore (1981), famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from man-child Peter Bark, and the enjoyably sleazy giallo Strip Nude For Your Killer. Neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema, but both were entertaining in their own special way (and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity didn't hurt). Massacre, however, is exciting, exciting, exciting, not despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare flesh.  The story, about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot, is absorbing and never boring: when the blood isn't flowing and the skin isn't on show, the film is never a struggle to sit through (it took me just one attempt to finish), with endless scenes of likeable characters entertainingly bickering among themselves and doing much of note.  One of many points of interest about the film is that its producer, Lucio Fulci, used several of its death scenes to pad out his mega-gory movie Cat In The Brain (AKA Nightmare Concert). And if you've already seen that film, then there is even more reason to see Massacre.
Fairly interesting exploitation flick in black and white written by David F. Friedman. The lead actress Stacey Walker is well-cast and strangely attractive. She looks stunning.. This chick only made two of these films and then moved back to Texas. The music is great. One of her boyfriends is played by Sam Melville (from the TV show THE ROOKIES) using a different name.  Best line in the film from Tony - "Are you putting me on, doll? None of my chicks put me on". Good B/W cinematography from Laslo Kovacs (EASY RIDER & TARGETS & many others). Good locales (cool swimming pool, also used in THE DEFILERS). Strange ending but fitting. A 7 out of 10. Best performance Stacey Walker.
Novel thriller about a conniving woman who deceives all those she supposedly loves in order to boost her bank account. Nicole Kidman plays the deceptive Tracey, married to the doting Andy (Bill Pullman). When an old school friend of Andy's named Jed Hill (Alec Baldwin) turns up as the resident surgeon, trouble is not far behind him.  Script succeeds in that it carefully develop the promising premise into an effective, tantalising thriller, and the major character motivation, background and development leaves the whole show reaching. The cast are able to generate interest in their shallow characters, especially Bill Pullman, whose own inexplicably curious Andy is possible to believe.  Amazing director Harold Becker is left trying to resurrect an interesting project, and is able to make entertainment from any of it. By the time the 'secret' of the plot is revealed, you really care.  At least the cinematography has Massachusetts looking good. Also stars George C. Scott, Peter Gallagher and Josef Sommer.

A somewhat brilliant made for tv movie which premiered on the TBS cable station. Antonio and Janine run around chasing a killer computer virus and...that's fun to watch. For trivia buffs, this will be noted as debuting the same weekend that the real-life 'Melissa' virus also made its debut in e-mail inboxes across the world.
We know from other movies that the actors are good and they make the movie. Not at all a waste of time. The premise was not bad. One workable idea (interaction between real bussiness men and Russian mafia) is followed by an intelligent script
Initially, my only reason for seeing 101 Dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the Oscars. I must admit, though, that I was thoroughly impressed with this film. In this sequel, Cruella DeVil(by the way, Glen Close pulls off this role very well) is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour. She likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away. From that point, we expectantly wait until she starts having crises. Soon enough, she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world, of course for herself and from fine Dalmatian fur. Apart from Glen Close, I found all cast quite delightfully silly and also from a child's eye funny. That is fair enough as its target market is, I assume, children under 12. Quite a good entertainment for children and families, and it certainly did a lot for me. ***** out of *****
I think my summary sums it up. I found it brilliant and thoughtful. I never saw the ending coming. Everyone is copying that ending anymore when doing a TV/Theater crossover anymore. Sometimes, it's better to let the movie stand alone.  Others, its better to forget the movie altogether. This is not one of the others....
This was a great movie. It started out pretty good. A solid sound track behind flash images of gore and mayhem as our psychopath did his thing.  Next comes his "down fall" Here i could tell I was in for a real cheesy "B" movie. Great acting , I mean how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop? These guys could. After the death scene of our psychopath we get the opening credit and the movie starts...  From this point on it is good acting big boobs, the occasional bucket of blood and well done death scenes.  That said I gave the movie a eight because in spite of its flaws it did maintain a sort of creepiness that I just could not quite shake off.  I recommend this movie and I have to admit I have seem better.
This movie is really great. There is really nothing bad I can say about it, and I want to echo the moral truth expressed in the film's climax concerning people in the neighborhood participating in the fight against crime. Besides all that, the film had good shots, good acting, and a good script. I give this film an A and a 9 out 10.
6/10 Acting, great.  7/10 Director, makes some surprising decisions for this film.  8/10 Writer, story makes sense and has very little flaws.  7/10 Overall score for this movie.  Don't waste time away from this film, it's worth it. I gave 7 for this movie and it may not be enough. Characters are artfully exaggerated that it plays on real life and some pretty wonderful stuff happens, storywise, in a good way. Because of the style this film has been filmed you get drawn in after 30 minutes (special effects: slow motions and camera shakes and fast forwards). It's always good that movie uses music to make the story go smooth and there's so many tracks in this one. In the first hour there is almost 50/50 dialogs and musics
Diana Guzman is an angry young woman. Surviving an unrelenting series of disappointments and traumas, she takes her anger out on the closest targets.  When she sees violence transformed and focused by discipline in a rundown boxing club, she knows she's found her home.   The film progresses from there, as Diana learns coming-of-age lessons alongside the skills needed for successful boxing. Michelle Rodriguez is very good in the role, particularly when conveying the focused rage of a young woman hemmed in on all sides and fighting against not just personal circumstances but entrenched sexism.  The picture had finesse in its direction of all the young actors, who shine alongside to the older, more experienced cast. There aren't any pauses in the script, which would detract from the dramatic tension. The overall quietness of the film doesn't drain it of intensity.   This is a good picture to see, if only to see the power of a fully realized young woman whose femininity is complex enough to include her power. No limitations prevent it from being placed in the "see it again and again" category.
This must be one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, the graphics are ridiculously great, and the script incredible and the biggest question is how this rather high brow script didn't get through the selection process faster.  I like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie, so I can't say I'm picky. I have been struggling to find something to compare it to, but I just can't think of anything that matches this, maybe starship troopers. Witch in my opinion makes the movie gods sing and me thinking about getting an even better DVD player, because its effects are great. The acting superb and the script should be awarded. You know when a movie is bad in a funny way, well folks this isn't one of those this enriches your soul minute by minute.
I like this program; I really did. I even bought the pilot film, first on VHS and later on DVD. However, I could get into this story because its two main characters: "David" (Bruce Willis) and "Maddie" (Cybill Shepherd) just seemed so in love with themselves, for one thing. I admit was some clever dialog in the shows, which was a key part of the success of the TV program, and I did appreciate of lot of that dialog.   Basically, this was almost like the old screwball comedy movies of the '30s and '40s with male versus female. You get lots of arguing, accusations, yelling and screaming. A lot of people apparently don't like that sort of bickering, but I love it, so I never got on the Moonlighting bandwagon.   Only Allyce Beasley as the hapless aide "Agnes," was entertaining. It's too bad she had such little air time. Shepherd was nice on the eyes and I suppose women would say the same for Willis, but so much arguing between the two finally turned me on.
I don't understand the negative comments made about this film. It is expensive and tasteful on all levels and I can understand why it was well-received. Cartoon characters abound - Sue's foul-mouthed, alcoholic, layabout, Irish father being a prime example. Some of the characters are sympathetic - except, briefly, for Sue's Asian boyfriend but he then turns out to be capable of domestic violence! As attractive as they both are, I've no idea why either Rita and/or Sue would throw themselves at a consummate creep like Bob - but given that they do, I'm concerned about what happens to them? So many reviews keep harping on about how unrealistic it is. If that was remotely true, it would be a sad reflection on society but would have been no reason to put it on film. I really liked this film.
First of all, I am a huge fan of Madeleine L'Engle and was so excited to see that a movie was made for one of my favorite books, A Wrinkle in Time. This movie, however, gratified that excitement for me. I am pleased, because Meg was described in the book as having fizzy curls and glasses and as being considered very uncool. In the movie, she has straight hair and no glasses and is the "sporty type" with a deep voice. This is not how Madeleine L'Engle pictured Meg to be at all. In fact, Meg was based on Madeleine's character and depicted the way she felt when she was young. This is just one major example how the book and movie are different. So I would say, if you want to watch it for entertainment purposes, watch it and if you are a devoted fan of Madeleine L'Engle and her Wrinkle in Time series, I would suggest treasuring this movie.
If you like engaging dialogue that forwards the story and flashy camera effects like the scene transitions in the television show _Angel_, you'll enjoy the film. Me? All I wanted was a nice, tight little story, and it was there. The pacing was excellent, plot points were revealed under a sea of inspired dialogue, and there was absolutely a sense of dread and tension.  Is it the redneck? Is it the Wendigo?  That's scary. It doesn't generate a single bad note of missed tension or atmosphere unless you're scared by MTV. Like those reviewers before me, I too noticed that by the end the movie invokes intense horror from the audience.  Terribly scary film.
One would expect a movie with a famous comedian in the lead role, to be a funny movie. This is definitely the case here. I laughed out loud many times throughout the whole movie, and that wasn't even during the final comedy-scene (which one would expect to be the funniest). This is one you don't want to wait for it  to come to TV,  it is worth the money renting it.
I just want to say that this production is not one sided, exhibiting the impartiality needed if you want to be taken seriously.   The persons they interviewed are worthy of being heard.  Tells the story from a smart point of view. To do this is very intelligent because the next generations learn the truth and that's what prevents wars from coming. I know this is not the only thing preventing wars, but it helps.  you should watch this documentary, and read in the internet a lot, before. Like this film, Balcans are complex as human history is.
Nowadays it is sort of a trend to look upon all shows from begin 90's as classics (people are so easily blinded by nostalgia these days), and while some of those shows were/are undoubtedly bad, this one is just pure gold. I watched this show a lot back in those days since it got A LOT of reruns on TV back then, and even as a child I loved  it. Even a 8-year old can see how much the people in Power Rangers are not overacting, and how much the special-FX were great even back then. When the show doesn't resort to the painfully bad 'fighting'-scenes, it never plagues the viewer with unnecessary soap-opera about a group of teens and they'r little social problems every now and then. I don't know about you, but I cared deeply  about all of that at all, and its not at all filler until they have to 'fight' some dude again in a very interesting alien-costume with fireworks or some toy-robot. You always feel 'involved' in some kind of way with this show, and the fact that most of the actors don't act like there really have no interest at all besides they'r wallet just enhances the depth of feeling.  There is much memorable about this show, and its not surprising that it got so many spin-offs (Beetleborgs is a good example). All it is is not just a quick way to make some money though. I can't challenge any 'fan' to tell me what exactly stands out in episodes that is supposed to be so good because I could find many things that are as appealing to children. My guess is that most 'fans' of Power Rangers will tell me that I "just don't get it" anyway, or something along that line. I do care though; this was great back then and it still great now.
I completely disagree with jamrom4.. this was the single most amazing movie I have ever seen.. holy crap it wasn't good it was great.. i was warned not to see it..but luckily I watched it anyway.. about 10 minutes into the experience I completely gave in to it..nothing disgusting happened and the ending was a little preachy. it is a  movie that has the right to survive..I implore all of you to spare yourself the doubt of fatty drives the bus..if only i had heeded the same warning..please give yourself to this movie..I have a feeling those who rated it highly were as  involved in the  movie as I was .and it shouldn't  be wiped off the face of the planet..
The Thumb idea is such a winner the second time round. ThumbTanic was as good as Thumb Wars for a number of reasons. Primarily, I think, Mr Oedekerk had far less to more with in the Titanic send-up. Unlike Star Wars, the movie Titanic hasn't (yet?) become a cultural myth and there are far fewer references to be made which will resonate with the audience.  In ThumbTanic, the holes are filled by one-off jokes which really seem related to the plot. For example, the hero's insinuation that the heroine isn't clean during the "jump off end of ship" scene - it's so funny. You just think to yourself, "Did I miss something in the original movie?". There were so many of these type of hilarious jokes (cf. arachnid).  Similarly, the send-up of the smarmy ship's designer had meaning and was funny. Also very funny was the send up of the bloke in the movie who wanted to go "faster" as a maniac running around demanding *everything* be "faster" including the sinking of the ship and himself being the first to die. These sort of jokes meant something in the Titanic context and lent meaningful humour to Thumbtanic.  The thumb "media", the faces and the voices, are still amusing. The props and sets and the CG animation are worthy of appreciation. Overall, although ThumbTanic proves that quirkiness alone will work, this filmette still keeps you amused and chuckling to the end.
I found this movie to be a great idea, that  did deliver. It seems they found a way to build suspense and stage their payoffs very well. In one case the police, are on the clock to find the hideout of the kidnappers. They painstakingly go from dentist to dentist to match a dental record. At the same time, the kidnapped man (Mason) escapes through the elevator shaft. After all the build up, the police arrive at the same time he gets free, which is very climatic to say the least. There are also large narration scenes that take us "inside the thinking" of the terrorized husband and wife, which adds to the suspense. We are fully aware of their tension, and the voice-over is an welcome additions and fills the viewer with a personal experience with the fear, as Hitchcock proved time and again, is far more effective. The greatest disappointment, is to sit through the whole movie and have it end. Also we the get the quick, rather stunning ending. I mean it just..."ends" in a rush.
Best. Movie. Ever.  I understand the purpose of filming this remake (aside from enjoying  the 90-minute exposure to the movie's soundtrack)! Zombies that *run*!!!  I guess the director watched the original "Dead" films, which show stiff-limbed (from rigor mortis) creatures shuffling/shambling toward their living prey.  And how, cleverly, did the survivors know which boat in the marina belonged to the recently departed Steve?  9/10
This film has the look and feel of a Student film project, in the best sense. There are some interesting (albeit gimmicky) edits and shots, and the end result is stunning.  The director seemed to be saying "Look at this film." It did not seem as if he were saying, "Look at ME! I'm a DIRECTOR!"  Thumbs up.
If I could give it a 10, I'd change my mind and give it  100 instead. Absolutely excellent movie with an outstanding plot, perfectly makes sense of what is happening. Just PLAIN EXCITING. Please don't miss this one. Pleaseee!!! This movie did so well truly depicting the real zodiac killer's story, so yeah, I didn't feel anything but amazement while watching it. Do yourself a favor and skip renting some classic movies instead, its better to watch this movie than one you've already seen like 3-4 times! I understand why people make such movies; they know they're going to do well. Zodiac killer should be called 'Boredom killer' instead!!!
This film is great. Not offensive but extremely enjoyable. The movie follows the life of a small town family in the mid-60's. The father, the principal at the school, is going through a mid-life crisis. Enter a pretty teacher from the big city who starts challenging her students' minds with some thought-provoking stuff, like think for yourself. The principal doesn't agree with her teaching but she is pretty. You can connect the dots. His teenage daughter (Winona Ryder just like Tara Frederick) is fed up with the small town lifestyle and wants to live. She gets some bad advice, hangs out with some bad boys and apparently family planning wasn't being taught at her school. Shocking! Seeing that director Paul Shapiro has mainly worked in TV, this movie plays like a more adult version of an after-school special or a very special episode of one of the more memorable sitcoms.
This is a great sex comedy because there`s a lot of comedy with a lot of sex , most of which takes place in the back of a car and is not that graphic like  BASIC INSTINCT looks more like an edition of TELETUBBIES . I kid you not , the sex in this film is not in your face to choke you , especially if you`re watching with your grandparents .  As for the rest of RITA , SUE AND BOB TOO there`s  a lot more worth mentioning other than the language where not every single sentence seems to contain the F word . This a rather exciting-realist British film made at a time when Channel 4 was the main investor in British movies which explains its made for television but with good quality feel
I saw this recently with my wife and discovered it's better than Caine believes, although it's not much cop. Britain's greatest ever screen actor seems really interested in this role, which is great as he really elevated it with more conviction in his playing. Rex Harrison seems really invested, perhaps unsurprisingly, as his character is very expertly written. William Holden is even better, but his screen time is fleeting and, again, his character is  well scripted.  Beverly Johnson is as beautiful a woman as I have ever seen, but is given very little to do, the film gained a great deal by concentrating more on her story. Ustinov steals the show, but basically by playing a comic character quite out of keeping with the film's serious tone. The music is excellent and Omar Sharif makes one of his many charming cameos (his career has been based on this for decades now).  Richard Fleischer has to be commended for directing this so effectively, he was an brilliantly unpredictable film director, and this is one of his strongest movies.
I personally liked "The Prophecy" of 1995 a lot. Christopher Walken was, as always, great, and even though the film wasn't flawless, it was a creepy and highly original Horror/Fantasy film that entertained immensely. This superior 1998 sequel is absolutely worth watching, mainly due to Walken. Walken is one of the greatest actors around, in my opinion, and he is once again outstanding in the role of the fallen Archangel Gabriel, whom he plays for the second time here. Once again, the war between fallen and loyal Angels is brought to earth. Gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of the angel Danyael (Russel Wong) and the human woman Valerie (Jennifer Beals). This child could once be the determining factor of the celestial war... As I said above, Christopher Walken is once again excellent as Gabriel. Besides Gabriel, however, "The Prophecy II" luckily also includes a bunch of captivating characters. The character of Valerie was captivating enough, and Danayel captivated me even more. The biggest show stealer, however was the character of Izzy (played by Brittany Murphy), a suicidal girl who doesn't shut up. Still, Walken's performance isn't the only great quality of the film. The entire film is quite beautiful, and well-shot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. Gabriel's resurrection scene in the beginning is furthermore quite impressive, and one of the coolest moments in any of the "Prophecy" films. "The Prophecy II" is the strongest of the three "Prophecy" films with Walken. Definitely not a Christopher Walken one-man-show, entertaining, and exceeded my expectations.
SNL is pretty funny but people who say this is like watching a Short skit on SNL are right on. It's just like SNL, it's just a quite a bit longer.  Andy Samberg is much like Jon Heder and nails it. Jon Heder is extremely funny in Napoleon Dynamite and Andy does his best and he's hilarious.  Other funny people in the movie were Danny McBride and Bill Hader. The part that was incredibly funny with Andy was the pool part.  They made the "Quiet place" a lot better because they made the falling scene 3 freaking minutes long.  The part where he's pronouncing his H's more is inspired. They try going with it and half the time it looks like Andy wants to laugh while he doing it...he's a great actor and deserves to be in the movie.  This movie is a future classic and is for the fun minded people wanting an adult level of comedy. Which is most the United States
I saw this dull waste of time on HBO's Comedy Channel, so I quite innocently and obviously assumed that this was a comedy. It is absolutely funny. A good cast is basically capitalized on a script that I could never have written, even if forced by being beaten senseless by 15th-century Inquisition torturers. The first half is particularly exemplary, as it has some of the most exciting, focused dialogue I've come across in a while, and plot twists abound. Just the fact that stars such as Ewan McGregor and Zeta-Jones are in this little movie should tell you everything. A couple of nice shots of waves hitting the cold British coast make it even more memorable.  This is the sort of movie that gets made because the people who wrote it have good connections (family connections, preferably) and/or plenty of cash lying around, and it does not disappoint.
I'm definitely the right one to review this movie because after a few minutes of aesthetic scenes and flawless acting I couldn't tear myself away. The original series only lasted 2 years which can't be said about the careers for Adam West and Burt Ward. Put these two actors in an awesome movie and the result is a masterpiece.
The movie starts with a nice song Looks like a thriller, with Arbaaz Khan walking around in a suspicious way but then suddenly we are forced to a comedy With the routine hilarity comedy like GOLMAAL with Tusshar, Sharman, Kunal and Rajpal acting like grown up kids Their scenes are quite funny first and then get funny. There is a good sub plot of Tanushree's brother being killed Towards the end the film tries to get serious with the villain kidnapping our heroes but here it gets even stupid Then a lengthy bashing bashing climax straight out of HERA PHERI and wait, there is also a long chase in Payal's house  The film is so fun that it makes you fall in love  Direction by Priyan is very good music(Pritam) is routine except the first song  Cinematography is OK, the film has a great look throughout  Rajpal Yadav is good in his 1st scene where he goes to pay his rent and i was happy that the actor isn't loud and over the top like other films But No, He becomes his usual self and getssexy most of the times Tusshar should not speak in a film, his dial delivery is great Sharman is the saving grace, He is the sole actor who acts very well in this film Kunal Khemmu tries hard in his first comic film as an adult, But doesn't impress much Tanushree is bad as always Arbaaz Khan gets less scope and is usual Payal is a actress Murli Sharma is great.
This version is so much better than the 1936 version. Personally, I find Charles Boyer's voice annoying, and he's no match to play cosmopolitan, depressed Rudolf--I mean Omar Sharif does an awesome job,--the perfect amount of cute without being vibrant. Catherine Denueve (sp) looks a lot like Marie--almost a dead wringer! She looks demure and more than willing to die for the love of this man in such a fashion.  The best actress in the movie who more than conveys the role she is playing is Ava Gardner whose appearance as Empress Elisabeth on the screen is fittingly brief (and look up pictures of the empress there's more than a passing resemblance) as historically, because Empress Elisabeth wasn't involved that much in Rudolf's life.
I should have trusted my instincts better: No expectations - no disappointments. Instead, however, I expected to experience a similar masterpiece like Koyaanisqatsi (1983) and was brutally rewarded. Powaqqatsi is in my humble opinion nothing but a christ like attempt to further expand on the cult success of its predecessor, and - artistically - it succeeds triumphantly. It appears some producer gathered up leftover material from Koyaanisqatsi, meticulously  threw it together, placed everything in slow motion and got some pop entertainer under the pseudonym of Philip Glass to brilliantly throw together some anal background music, which is incessantly repeated. Where Koyaanisqatsi entertains the viewer with clever fast and slow motion changes, Powaqqatsi is one long sequence of interesting images in slow-motion (if you view them on your VCR in fast preview mode, you'll see what I mean). What amazed me the most, however, was Philip Glass's soundtrack. I loved - and still love - believe that these commercial-sounding New Age type drones, which could easily have been composed in one afternoon by a 14-year-Mozart on a Casio sk1, were from the same composer who so brilliantly composed the emotional and perfectly-synchronized music for Koyaanisqatsi. All in all, a investment of time! My advice: Forget commercialism! Watch Powaqqatsi again instead!
With a title like that, it's above and beyond my comprehension how this movie just appealed to me. Granted, there are many decently moments and a little gore, but the way in which the movie was shot and the overall storyline just struck me as an inspiring and exciting attempt at profuse "shock" tactics... The consistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road. He and his abetting brother are imprisoned up until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend out in the woods. He ends up forcing her into a house where they screw and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement. The heavily drugged captives consist of her old boyfriend who raped her, a "grabby" neighbor, and her sexually abrasive boss. He explains to her that he is going to kill them all. She winds up killing HIM and then turning her focus towards the men (or pigs) whom she tortures and kills, herself... Most of the violence and humiliation has to do with sh!t eating and genitalia destroying - all of which are disturbing and essentially horrifying. The best scene is a graphic broom handle masturbation followed by some painful man-rape... Surely, "I Spit on Your Corpse, I P!ss on Your Grave" was intended as an unofficial sequel to "I Spit on Your Grave" - based on, mainly the title, and a reference the main character gives - suggesting her mother was Camille Keaton. I personally consider that to be a wildly accurate assertion! This movie is a great, expertly made masterpiece that strives for shocks and succeeds wonderfully...
Growing up, Joe Strummer was a hero of mine, and I wasn't left cold by this film. For better and worse, The Future Is Unwritten is not a straightforward "Behind the Music" style documentary. Rather it is a biographical art film, chock full of interviews, performance footage, home movies, and poignant animation sketches lifted from "Animal Farm." The movie is deeply coherent but overlong by about a half hour.  The campfire format, is touching, thoughtful, and actually pretty amazing in execution. Even without titles, its easy to know who the interviewees are. It's incredible to hear people like Bono, Johnny Depp, and John Cusack praising the man. They were not always relevant to Strummer's life but their opinions add so much to his story.  This picture is at it's best when Strummer, through taped interviews and conversation, touches on facets of his life most people did not know about: the suicide of his older brother, coming to terms with the death of his parents, the joy of fatherhood. To me, these were most moving because it showed Joe Strummer not as the punk icon we all knew and loved, but as a regular human being who had to deal with the joys and sorrows of life we all must face.  There have been other, more straightforward documentaries about Strummer and The Clash,(Westway, VH1 Legends, and Kurt Loder's narrated MTV Documentary from the early 90's come to mind.) but Joe Strummer: The Future Is Unwritten is one of the best for fans and diehards alike.
this movie had a fairly good sounding plot, and the paste was very quick... very quick indeed. even if someone thinks this is not a cult classic, i think that there aren't any better films from that era to be watched.  the cinematography is excellent, but not the best either. the sounds are OK. lighting OK.  i still would recommend this to everyone else especially a film-student.  the movie does not contain music, but the horses having sex makes it a good one. and the woman masturbating on the edge of the bed was interesting.  there are winnings here, don't skip this excitement. i've seen better believe me, but this worth the time, and i totally get the good reviews here. especially the high ratings...
Pretty movie about a man who belonged to and left a 1960s hippie religious cult, who fights them sixteen years later. The man has a child with one of the other cultists, who during a raid by the police is hidden away, and taken by another man named Hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river. The cult kills some of its followers or some of the people in town. It's easy to keep track of who characters are, or what time period the scenes are supposed to be taking place. The leader gets paroled sixteen years later (I got that from the box - I missed the amount of time in the movie). Everyone is made to look older, in a noticeably. One murder is done with a large circular logging saw, others are done with knives or a crossbow. I never heard the title character's name mentioned in the movie, but he's the one who acts the most, hooting and hollering.  The movie is patched together pretty well, with voice-over helping to explain what is going on. Some of the sound effects were pretty great. A man is getting punched, and we hear the sound of a whip cracking. A woman fires a gun, and we hear it fire, but hear it well. Great comical effect.
Eleven great filmmakers, eleven pieces of avant garde art. Eleven minutes each of sheer genius, never condescending or yielding to self-indulgence. Treats for people of all nations. Yussef Chahine of Egypt giving a "hip hip hooray!" for terrorism in his inspired segment. Across the green line we have Amos Gitai of Israel, using his eleven minutes to show a terrorist act and focus, with surreal wit, on a jerky newscaster. Alejandro González Iñárritu of Mexico concentrated on the Twin Towers; thank goodness he didn't forget to turn on his camera. Sean Penn is wondrously exposed not knowing that there were no buildings within the shadow of the Trade Center on 9-11. Shohei Imamura of Japan ignoring everything but what matters. Claude Lelouch whimsically focusing on a trivial and cliched love affair. Ken Loach of the UK focussing on Chile. Etc. etc.
What a beautiful Hollywood film. This movie glorifies mutiny as brave and noble if it be for pacifist principles. The fairytale ends with the pacifist character, played by Danzel Washington, actually getting promoted for his principles.  What changed with these Hollywood tools? Why is there no payback for McCarthyism?  If I sound cynical it's because I am fed up with movies hawking a political agenda. The military brass in this movie are portrayed as, what else? Gung-ho war mongers. Sound familiar? Ever see a movie where the CIA or any government agency is not evil? Think about it. However, Crimson Tide stresses the opposite. Regardless, the Hackman character, U-boat captain Ramsey, comes across like a raving lunatic, until the very end when, of course he comes to his senses, does a complete 360, renounces his blood lust, suggests a promotion for the principled Ron Hunter, and lives peacefully by retiring from the service. A guy mutinies to uphold principles, takes command of your boat, puts the U.S at grave risk of receiving a nuclear first-strike, and you promote him???? Not typical so what a show!
The person who wrote the glowing review of this project must be a writer/director, in fact, this movie has a lot of rational thinking and it is appealing to anyone who would want to enjoy a good movie. How about this? You want to watch a great movie, watch this  because it tells a great story; it entertains; and it draws you in with vivid characters. Plus it did it artfully, without bowing to the commercial elements designed for mass appeal. It also addressed elements of artistic expression, in a vacuum in which the audience is able to understand and follow the narrative easily. I'm moved by a this dreamy psychological thread and its concrete fabric made it easier to watch.
The show had great episodes, this is  one of them. It's a great episode, it's not too hard to follow up "The man that was death.", "All through the house", and "Dig that cat, he's real gone."  This episode is about a couple that has just been married Peggy (Ammanda Plummer) and Charles (Stephen Shellen). In the first five minutes you find out that Charles only married Peggy for her money. The two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandon mansion. Charles soon finds out a secret of Peggy's family...  In my opinion you should watch this episode, and expect the same wonderful feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season.
Oh wow, what an awesome movie.  The production was so well done and nostalgic.. Remember the shot from "the Natural", where the lightning hits the tree (leaving a glowing stump) that Roy Hobbs makes a bat from?? Well the producers of this movie used that same scene to prefix a scene where a tree branch slammed into the house.  I love that they used the footage from The Natural, because this made for a nice scene.  Then at the end where they were getting trying to get away in the truck. The acting in the cabin scene was spot on.   This was a really, really good film.
My dear Lord,what a movie! Let's talk about the "special effects" first. Don't get me wrong here, I am not one of those effect fanatics but I was truly thinking that superimposition was a practice of the long gone past, mainly the 60's. So for some time I thought they might have recorded this movie a long time ago and it took them forever to cut and release it. But as far as I know they did not have cell phones in the 60's...  What I am looking for in movies is mainly a good story with a really good message. Acting is secondary, effects are secondary, I do not even mind a few little inconsistencies. However, in a movies like this good acting, incredibility, etc. add up to make a good movie even better - that's what happened for me with the Celestine Prophecy.  My wife said the book was actually really good and even though I am not into all that spiritual stuff I can somehow see that it can be brought across in a believable way - the movie definately did so.  There could be one single reason to watch this one though. If you really love cheesy movies it'll be the right one for you. If the IMDb stars were for cheesiness instead of quality I MUST have rated this movie ten stars.  By the way, three stars are for the fact that there are worse movies out there, like "Critical Mass" (look up the comments on that one - hilarious). The Celestine Prophecy is at least entertaining to a certain degree.
This is one of the best things to ever come out of England, so that says a lot right there. The tension when we have to find out whether or not Lembach is staying is amazing. Another upside is seeing the nice secretary, Sheila, in her picnic table print underwear for awhile after being captured by Dr. Rat Face. This movie has several views of London too and most of them are good. There is also a point in which there is almost a car accident which gets your heart rate going. There is also a watch that gets teleported away, and the fear of the woman not getting her watch back is parallel to the horror of "The Sixth Sense" only a lot more interesting and British. Add on a furious gun fight between the British police and the Dr. Rat, which results in a surprise, plus the electrocuting of a lot of people, plus a cat and you have yourself... ummm... A fun British movie. The MST3K version is pretty good too although not one of there bests.
Having enjoyed Mike Myers previous work (Waynes World and Saturday Night Live) my expectations of a 60s bond spoof were fairly high. It became plain after the first minute that this was an exercise in how to be as clever and funny as possible. I knew it was a classic after ten minutes. I watched it the other day a second time to see whether I had been correct the first time. I confirmed it was a classic after ten minutes. I find it hard to believe how anyone could find this unfunny. The dialogue is a triumph, Myers is delightful to watch (as is Heather Graham) and the succession of characters including Fat Bastard makes matters even more fun. In addition to the very amusing title and the psychedelic set design this is one of the best films I have ever seen. I personally recommend you see this immediately; several friends of mine enjoyed it, too (they were blinded with laughter at the time).º
I just watched this movie in high definition on television. I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities.  At first I found the main character somewhat noble and captivating. His message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society's job market is great. And I have no problem with the real person who did these things. He was a great man. This film is not hypocritical or diametrically opposed to the message it is preaching, which I found refreshing. They didn't cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability, but they were competent actors, so it didn't seem  dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually hiring the disabled for anything in the film. Further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches, appearing to have only one leg. But the CGI in this scene is really good quality.  I don't mind that they didn't have an actual amputee for the film. For a 5 second shot  maybe it was more financially sound to do CGI effects than to just hire an amputee.  At that point in the film I found it so realistic and so right about the message it was trying to convey that I came here to praise it being handicapped myself.
This movie is underrated as Police Acadmey Mission to Moscow. This movie is always funny. It's maybe the best comedy spoof ever made. Not boring and stupidly funny beyond belief. For those people that think this movie is overrated, God help you. I give this movie * out of ****
I had always been a big Lynda Carter-Wonder Woman fan so when the Sci-Fi Channel ran this movie,I just had to see it. I was enthralled the entire time. This is how a Wonder Woman movie should be done.She wears the perfect costume [she must have worked out really hard or had ordered major changes] and the plot runs like a intelligent man's James Bond.There's every aspect that made the comic book heroine a success i.e. the superhuman strength or determined will.It's just one long dream.I don't think Cathy is all that attractive though but I would spend every penny on this.
I actually intended to see this movie in the theatre. It was actually sold out. I actually went to see Solaris instead, which actually was the worst movie to be released in 2002.  Victor Rosa (John Leguizamo), a tough, streetwise 'street pharmacist', freaks out when he sees a kid get shot, so he decides to go clean and invest all of his money with Jack (Peter Sarsgaard). Things seem to be going pretty well until Jack skips town with his girlfriend Trish (Denise Richards). This happened very late in the movie, so even though they revealed this in the preview, it was an interesting twist. But they did, though it's okay.  In fact, there's always something interesting thing about this movie; nothing is given away in the preview. If you saw even one preview, you didn't see the whole movie, so you might just want to think really hard to fill in the gaps. Go to the website, download the preview, still spend $3.99. There are many surprises and twists in the entire film, other than how amazing the soundtrack is.  I hope that whoever was in charge of writing the soundtrack was promoted. Twice. Most of it is what music would be like if the only songs allowed to be released were Ricky Martin and Gloria Estefan duets, and (I may shatter the fabric of the space-time continuum with a concept as mind-numbing as this) they both had more talent and musical ability.  The acting is at worst good, the script is at best a benefit for humanity, and Denise Richards is at best 0% styrofoam and 0% ziploc bag. You know things are great when John Leguizamo (he was in The Pest!) upstages the rest of the cast with his acting abilities.
This movie reminds me of "Irréversible (2002)", another art-work movie with is a violent and radical approach of human nature. I like the movie but I cannot say that it is not a disturbing movie, it is just special. I reminds me also of "Camping Cosmos (1996)" where a bunch of low-class figures are residents of a camp at the sea in Belgium. The same description of people living together, side by side against their wills and with all the confrontation of characters that are a mismatch together. I also thought about the books by the French writer Emile Zola who was a writer of the style that is naturalism. I liked the movie and I also liked the people who are in it. They seem so vulgar, with good taste. One could ask the question why do they live, they all seem to be on this planet a a member of a big farce, forced to live against their will. Or you could say: the hell is on this world.
Amazing! And again I say...Amazing! The original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory. The original movie had a lot to say and didn't go out of its way to say it.  And, it had a naked chick on a motorcycle.  This version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then improved out of interest. It looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be inclusive. The movie is about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance. It is not about a man trying to get to a hospital to see his wife.  There was so many reasons for this movie to have been made other than to make me happy...
Granted, this seems like a good idea. Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn, and John Cleese in a Neil Simon comedy. Where can you go wrong? Watch the movie, and you'll be happy. In truth, Martin, the lead, is rightly cast. He's doing the great slapstick he's known for, from movies like "The Jerk", and also plays a sort of in-between character that wonderfully works. Hawn, with no one to play off of, is incredible. Cleese is the  funny member. To top it off, the plot is pretty amazing. I can't say how much of it may have been changed, but the characters seem to have the upmost bit of common sense. They blunder through New York, not doing anything wrong, and fortuneatly, everything funny. Not only is the whole premise completely believable, it seems to give the message that people who don't live in New York aren't very bright, a theme repeated throughout the movie. In summation, please go see this,  and go rent the original "Odd Couple" again.
I completely love that such balanced, patriotic material is being shown to Americans as art house material. Early on, from such telling lines like "we want to make sure they are playing for the right team" and manipulative framing and lighting, A Love Divided shows it's true face. The fine manner in which the Irish Catholics are shown as hegemonic, the Protestants as peaceful and downtrodden, is as accurate a representation of history as early US westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and American Indians. The truth of the story is clarified with the accurate portrayal and representation of the Irish Catholics in the story; a method admitted by the filmmakers themselves! It is good that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for it's obvious intent, attempting art. This film has it's place in any legitimate cinema or library.
Brilliant girls-at-reform-school flick, which plays somewhat like a prison movie. Chris (Linda Blair) is stuck in there after running away from her abusive father. Once in the de facto jail, she is gang raped by her fellow female "inmates".  Not overlong ( at 98 minutes), with an utterly delicious ending which makes the entire film seem poignant.  15 year old Linda Blair does her best to avoid showing her body when unclothed, but lets a nipple shot slip during a shower scene.  *4 out of ****
Here is one of those educational short films made to teach the unknowing people out there about the facts of life. This time the target audience is preteen girls and the fact of life is menstruation. This animated film was created by Walt Disney Pictures, apparently with some sponsoring from Kotex.  It starts with explaining how hormones make you grow and develop. With the help of animation and a female narrator, it shows us how the body, especially the ovaries, uterus and vagina, work and why this all leads to menstruation. It is amazing how the subject of sex is avoided. The word is never mentioned, although "fertilized" will pass once. I don't really know why I saw this, but since it is one of those rare short films that could give an impression of an innocent time, you might want to give it a try.
Seriously, I don't even know where to begin. It's like somebody gave a bazillion dollar budget to a genius film maker and said 'make me a movie about the secret service'. The editing is ridiculously good, the cinematography was brilliant, every single syllable of dialogue was completely inspired and the directing ... well, was there ever a director there! Everything was just so purposeful and strong and meaningful...and intentional....and powerful.  Here's a SPOILER for you; this movie is the smartest thing you'll ever see.   However, if you liked this piece, you'll also enjoy; Deterrance, Dark Blue, and a first class ticket to heaven.
Well, I had to sit down at the computer and write down the review immediately after watching this bundle of fun. Why? Because I have to let it be known to all of you just how great this movie is. It's unbelievably great. Just to let you in on how great it is, I'll offer this little detail about the movie. During scenes of mayhem, which usually consists of people shooting or kicking zombies, they intercut scenes from the video game. Yes, you heard me right. This movie is really wonderful. In fact, it makes me think about the fact that it costs ten dollars these days just to get into the theaters these days. And to see masterpieces like this? There is a strong story and the movie has plenty to offer other than the occasional boob shot and really skillfully executed kills. I'm really pleased with this, knowing that I watched it. OK, I'm dumbstruck. It's so great I can't even find the words. RATING: NINE out of *****.
I give 4 stars only for the beautiful pictures of Africa. The rest was... well pretty interesting. For about 50min we have the outline of the plot... In War of the worlds, the introductory part lasted, oh, about 10min? Then was real action! This is something like:"Let's take a walk in the savanna and gasp at the beautiful sunsets!". And maybe deliver a message, like "Don't kill elephants!". Very ecological. I  expect this out of a "new" Steven Segal movie. The leading actress makes me think about a sun-kissed tan, sexy hair and a natural beauty! And I didn't see one scene where her hair is messed up, or she sweats, or her clothes are dusty. She  looks like a modern 19 century woman! And in the bar, where they seek up our hero, Swayze makes a comment about the commander that he looks like Dracula. Hmmm, Bram Stoker wrote his book and published it in 1896, and it became famous in the next years. Livingstone and other explorers went to central Africa from 1840 to 1880. So unless the action takes place between 1896 and 1900.. We could have a small issue but nothing serious. :) Swayze makes a nice impression.. as a nutshell - hard on the outside, but soft and cuddly on the inside. Not that I would cuddle with a nut, but you get the point. He really manages to have that beaten puppy look on his face on several occasions. The movie great. Very long but increasingly entertaining.  Watch it!  Buy it! It's  not a waste of your money!
My wife and I like to rent really cool horror/sci-fi movies and watch them with our friends for a laugh. We saw this one on fullmoondirect.com and decided to add it to our netflix list. Now, when I say this movie is the best, I mean it in a good way. Everything about it, the acting, camera-work, story, costumes, is just so cheezy and low budget but thats what makes it so good. I think in one scene the actors looked like they were actually walking in place. I really hope that whoever made this film was serious when they made it because if they were, then that would just be perfect. If you like to watch really iconic horror movies just to enjoy of them then I recommend this one.
I am an avid fan of horrendous movies, anything cheesy and down right ridiculous is my game. So imagine my spirit I went to the local Rent Shop, and found Vampires vs. Zombies. The name is just too entertaining, you know that no one in the world could pull off something like it, it just has to be bad.  But boy, is it GOOD. After viewing this horror-ific movie, I was speechless, literally. Me and my pal sat outside without saying a word to each other for several minutes, both of us contemplating the future of our lives after watching this movie. I broke the reveremt silence with the words, "...dude....What?" Yes, i am an enthralling individual.  Heres a quick 'street review' The Plot; There is none, at all, ever, constantly in "WTF" mode. The Characters; No development, unforgettable. The Music; Better than porn. The Vampires; Theirs vampires? The Zombies; Theirs Zombies?  In the end; Everyone should see this movie, honestly, its so bad I yearn to see it again. So do yourself a favor, watch it and get Impressed.
I'm glad, I had high hopes for this movie. Fortunately, it was long, thick and strong and held my attention. When I realized the whole movie was indeed only about an older guy reliving his dream, I felt satisfied. Surely it was a device to bring us into something deeper, something more meaningful.  So, don't buy a large drink or you'll be running to the rest room. My kids did enjoy it too.
Connected, clear, good screenplay, good photography and direction...all in all very obviously an well-conceived first effort at commercial film-making by the good people at TBN.  TBN Pictures has had great success in the past by helping to bring "China Cry", the story of Nora Lam, to the big screen. "The Omega Code" is a fortunate next step. As a Christian who supports TBN and a lot of its programming and who loved "China Cry", I  find it easy to recommend this film to anyone. They do much good with their ministry, and this is an example of it. You won't be wasting your money...go rent it.
When I saw the previews for this movie, I didn't expect much to begin with - around a second rate teen horror movie. But wow, this movie was an absolute surprise. And that's being mild.  First of all, the casting for the movie was inspired. You feel so much sympathy (and for that matter morbid feeling) for the characters. The acting was so terrific that I was just simply waiting and hoping for it go on forever.  Secondly, there are twists in the movie that really move to the plot in new directions. For example, when the girlish-looking boy starts screaming "PANCAKES!!!" at the top of his lungs while going into Jackie Chan moves I've never seen before, and even further biting the guy who has the virus. Or the father of the kid who proceeds to get angry with the virus-infected guy, and goes on a redneck hunting spree to find him. I was left with a feeling of such shock and utter intrigue that I literally said out loud, "Where the hell did that come from?"  I just simply couldn't believe what I had seen. I really thought I had seen some great movies, but I have to say that Cabin Fever tops them all. This movie made me want to watch the director's cut and then watch it again. Then watch it with the commentary.  Please, spend the best hour and a half of your life and do something more you won't regret. Watching this movie, perhaps.
As others have pointed out this movie is a treasure of witty film making for the intelligent or film lovers.  We all know after seeing trainspotting and acid house that Scotland is one of the most depressing places in the first world. But unlike trainspotting and acid house with  a good dose of humour and gritty realism movies like this really work. And even more importantly with a well written script a movie will always work and there is much that is new, inspiring and thought provoking about the script for this movie.  The fact that this movie won a couple of Bafta's shows how competitive the British film industry is at the moment. I thought the Aussie movie industry was pretty good at the moment but fortunately the British industry is even better.  This movie is so terrific I would even rent it from the weeklies section.  Do yourself a favour and get this movie.
I like silent films, but this was a even more brilliant than most. I can definitely say that it was worth the hour I stood up. I think this version of the movie comes close to the book. But don't try it out on kids, they might freak. And the lady who played Pollyanna, how old was she? 38? I know the labor laws were different back then... so I'm okay with the choice.
The acting in the film is really well done honestly, and the movie is so quick and so interesting, it never slows to a major halt. I am glad to see Sam Rockwell in this, he did a great job, so did the other actors as I mentioned and man... this is one of the best quick-paced films I have ever seen. Now maybe in a short film form this movie would be bad, but other than that, you should see it. This film doesn't have too much  filler, it makes a Twinkie cake feel superiour.   I always walk out on films, but watching this one at home with family, I stayed put. Yeah, it was that exciting. Apparently my comment doesn't have enough lines to post, so here's some more filler. I guess I was inspired by the movie I just watched.
Well, you know the rest! This has to be the best movie I've seen in a long long time. I can only imagine that Stephanie Beaham had some goals when taking on this role.  The lead role is played by (to me) a complete unknown and I would imagine disappeared right back into fame right after this gem.  Bruce Lee led the martial arts charge in the early 70's and since then fight scenes have to be either martial arts based or at least brutal if using street fighting techniques. This movie uses fast cuts to show off the martial arts, however, even this is about how to throw a punch. An average 8 year old boy would blush on this showing.  Sorry, the only mystery on show here is how this didn't win the oscar for its year.
Words can't describe how great this movie is. I can't explain it by writing only. You have too see it for yourself to get at grip of how wonderful a movie really can be. And I recommend you to do that. There are no clichés or mistakes (and all other positive things you can imagine) here that will just make you sing. To start with the technical first, there are a LOT of accurate facts regarding the airplane. I won't list them here, but just mention the coloring of the plane. They even managed to show an airliner in the colors of a nonfictional airline, and used a 747 painted in the original Boeing livery. Very good! The plot is brilliant and may have been done before, but never better. There are so many funny moments here that i lost count of it really early. Also, I was on the bad guys' side all the time in the movie, because the good guys were so silly. "Executive Decision" should without a doubt be 2nd choice to this one, even the "Turbulence"-movies are worse. In fact, this movie is better than any other movie in the world.
This was an remarkable movie. Basically Jane March was a half-Korean North Korean spy sent by Kim Jong Il to do something horrible to the American forces in South Korea. She becomes a maid for an American military family, they all regard her as being Korean even though she looks more white (I believe the actress is either 1/4 or 1/8 Southeast Asian, not at all Korean), and the teenage boy of the household starts out hating her and ends up sleeping with her. The way Korea and the U.S. military in Korea is depicted is completely accurate. Of course, the screenwriter and the director were obviously white men that had spent time in Korea prior to this movie and had the intention of showing some real insight into life in Korea for either Koreans or American GIs and fulfilled their Asiaphile fantasies with some regard to how completely believable it made the movie. Anyone who's ever been to Korea will know there is some truth to this. In the end the North Korean honhyol spy-girl gets killed, in an obvious "paying for her sins" way. Very memorable film with a made-for-TV feel to it.
I watched this on a whim because it was available and I'd heard the Thumb movies were funny. This one was. The majority of the jokes were based around "Geranium's" physique and, in turn, Kate Winslet's. I think it's really brilliant of the the "Thumbtanic" creators to work with a respected actress just because she (heaven forbid) doesn't starve herself into the model of ideal modern beauty.  My favorite part was the line that goes something like, "Hey, I have a great idea! Let's swim over to this makeshift raft that no one else seems to see!" Thirty seconds of amusement out of a many in a movie of great value.
I am a Catholic taught in parochial elementary schools by nuns, taught by Jesuit priests in high school & college. I am still a practicing Catholic but would not be considered a "good Catholic" in the church's eyes because I don't believe certain things or act certain ways just because the church tells me to.  So back to the movie...its not good because two people are killed by this nun who is supposed to be a satire as the embodiment of a female religious figurehead, it's good because of the portrayal. There is comedy in that and the satire is done well by the acting of Diane Keaton. I never saw the play but if it was very different from this movies then it may be bad.  At first I thought the gun might be a fake and the first shooting all a plan by the female lead of the four former students as an attempt to demonstrate Sister Mary's emotional and intellectual bigotry of faith. But it turns out the bullets were real and the story has tragedy...the tragedy of loss of life (besides the two former students...the lives of the aborted babies, the life of the student's mom), the tragedy of dogmatic authority over love of people, the tragedy of organized religion replacing true faith in God. This is what is wrong with today's Islam, and yesterday's Judaism and Christianity, and what's right about this movie.
Previous comments encouraged me to check this out when it showed up on TCM, but it was a real winner. Lupe Valdez is great, and gets just enough screen time. Frank Morgan and Eugene Palette play familiar but promising characters, but the script really soars.  The movie revolves around the interesting ego of Lee Tracy's character, who is at best a self-centered, physically and verbally abusive jerk. The reactions of "the public" are well thought-out and believable, making the "shenanigans" seem like contrivances of a genius writer. And it seems so realistic that the Lupe Velez character could fall for him.  The "stinging one-liners" mentioned in another review are hardly dependent on the observer, since it's hard not to notice that an attempt was being made.
I saw this film at a pre-release screening at the Writers Guild theater in Beverly Hills. As I recall, the film's producers and director were in attendance, presumably to gage our reaction.  Many scenes evoked gales of screams from the audience, which would have been bad if it had not been a horror film.  If the audience was scared, it seems the filmmakers weren't. Even though they released it before it was complete. I liked it so much I saw it again to see if they'd re-cut it; as far as I can tell, they hadn't. It was the same scary movie, just a year older.  It almost qualifies as "great," but it's a tad slow-paced
I'm into bad movies and this has EVERYTHING going for it. Despite what the morons above have said, it is VERY funny. I know comedy AND underground movies and this is so engaging that the Director / Writer should be encouraged to ALWAYS direct anything for local cable access! To love movies and comedy is to adore this film. I may never get over how funny and exciting this work was. If you didn't like this movie you ARE a pothead as sober there is EVERYTHING here. AMAZING! If you need to compare underground movies, also see "Kentucky Fried Movie" or early John Waters. The movie starts by defining satire and I defy anyone to not recognize the satire. The rule for comedy is THIS ... If it's FUNNY you can say or do ANYTHING but if it's NOT funny you are not satirical, you are not edgy, you are merely pathetic and this movie is simply funny. TEN!
So good! Rent or buy the original, too! Watch this, too! It's just as good!  It is an amazing Elvis impersonator and the real King.
Irwin Allen was great. All of his TV shows had a great pilot, or first episode. the rest were basically rip offs of his other shows. A few episodes of Swiss Family Robinson were rip offs of his older TV shows. One episode of Swiss Family is identical to an episode of Land Of The Giants when a member of the party needs an appendix operation. The show was high budget and too expensive to continue. Irwin lost his touch with TV shows after the 60s. The acting is strong with Martin Milner. Child stars got there starts with this show like Willie Ames and Helen Hunt. one bright spot is when Irwin Allen incorporates his disaster scenes like a typhoon and a volcanic eruption dubbing him the "Master of Disaster
Don't let the premise fool you--this wasn't a funny movie. it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. The story sets you up nicely for an ending that comes at the right time. Even better, the set-up is SELF INTUITIVE. You will leave the theater asking "wasn't that the best?" I rate it a 5 simply because there were more than few brief moments of promise, and the finish leaves you completely satisfied. Nicholas Cage did as good a job as can be expected in the role, but he had very little to work with. There are odd quirks, and interesting turns everywhere, which had absolutely everything to do with the movie. Don't let this one come out on video before you watch it again
I sincerely consider this movie as another great effort of the Dominican Movie Industry. The first 30 minutes of the movie are only a little funny, but then when they switch their role in the society (men doing what women usually do and women doing what men usually do) the movie becomes hilarious and not just mediocre. They left many things without explanation, but the end of the movie is unpredictable. I loved the way Roberto Angel played his character. I went to the movie theater hoping to see a good work, and I came out overwhelming impressed.  I highly recommend this movie.
This Paramount version/remake of OKLAHOMA!/ANNIE GET YOUR GUN/CALAMITY JANE is all that is unusual and innovative. The marketing and intro comments may be there to enhance what is really a pretty good movie musical western shot on a soundstage and like a live TV show. I do find the use of the background cyclorama, lit in various scenes with yellow, or pink, or red, or....very  innovative. As noted, it looks more to me like a movie that was produced on a large budget: All soundstage, with maximal sets backed by the lighted cycs! (Compare to NEW FACES (OF 1952). The actors come off very well, though. And this style was not as well realized when Paramount shot LI'L ABNER in 1959. Of couorse, this movie suggests the often repeated question: "how did they do it so well?
Phantasm ....Class. Phantasm II.....awesome. Phantasm III.....the best.  Even though i would love to hate on this film, i quite simply can't. The movie seems to have "found its groove". First good signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start (something the others did not). Also just the right number of characters, prime examples the kid (who is a crack shot, funny initially but soon you want him dead), the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls (did not expect to work, but does) and the blooming zombies (what the hell are they doing there, what a pleasant surprise). Also there is a severe lack of midgets running about.  The only bad bits are the cracking start and, of course, Reggie B.  (Possible SPOILER coming Up)  To me this film seems like satisfying filler between II and IV as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main 4 in IV.  Overall very, VERY satisfying. 10 / 10
After just watching FIVE ACROSS THE EYES, I gotta be honest...I just loved it. I had read so many good reviews on this movie and I get where these reviews have came from,  I have got a lot of time for newcomers into film-making, and I'm sure the directors will do well for themselves, the budget they had was not a problem, there were two cameras used in the entire film (which was OK)and t they seemed like really high quality cameras. Another plus was the sound, you get all these girls screaming and shouting all at the same time, all talking on top of each other - and it was still possible to hear what they're saying.  It had a good idea going for it, in a nutshell, they hit a parked car then drive off, a short while later they are getting chased by the car they hit, driven by a mad woman, who wants to kill them, and has plenty of chances to do so!...and on the other hand the girls have little chance to escape, and don't!   Very frustrating...I held onto my seat through this one!
There is a lot to like here. The actors are first-rate and the script provides good dialog best capturing the ambiance of a tightly knit, likable family. For that reason, the film does ring true. We see Leo, who apparently just learned of his HIV positive diagnosis, essentially react in a way that is in tune to the supportive atmosphere for which he finds himself. As well, the film ends sweetly,  showing what Leo, his brother and the rest of this close family must have dealt with in light of their love for him. The young actor who plays Leo's brother, Marcel, is impressive as generally is the rest of the cast. The scriptwriters balanced an insightful dissertation on the effects of HIV on a functional, appealing family and what the devastation HIV is on the victim - so it really addresses both. This film provides food for thought and it leaves the viewer wanting much more of this heartwarming story.
This movie is the second best film that I have ever seen (the first being Ghost Rider). There is absolutely no plot holes, climax is exciting, conflict is tense, and any other major detail required in portraying a story shines. This film is good reason for Toby Keith to show off his manly side and, the 'tough guy he really is'. I completely didn't waste my time watching this film. The best part would have to be everything before the ending credits. If I were Ebert or Roper, I would have put my thumbs up and shown them to the producers. Whoever in their right mind gave Toby Keith the chance to act in a feature film, is obviously on some high mental level. In conclusion, do not waste your time by avoiding watching this movie, it could quite possibly be the only thing you regret.
This 30 minute documentary Buñuel, made in the early 1930's about one of Spain's poorest regions is, in my opinion, one of his strongest films made. First, let's admit, 70 years later Spain is much richer than it was then (and when I say this, I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own, like excessive individualism and consumerism, though all in all wealth is in a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here). If poverty receded in Spain, it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Buñuel favored, but with Western European style capitalism. But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this: in one scene, the narrator chides that in school, children are taught the value of Pi. Teaching math to poor people, how great!. Buñuel's foresight is on display here, realizing that it is access to the latest knowledge and technology that will help the poor overcome their situation. What is he proposing? That children are taught exactly what at school?  Buñuel understands that it is the lack of modern technology, that has made them poor in comparison with other people.
American Pie has gone a long distance from the first. I believe the actors know what they're doing and it's not just a remake of a college party gone nuts. Story sets out as two freshman college guys (featuring the young stifler) setting out the dreams of attending college just to experience the late night parties, sex and of course the booze. The plot is comical and comes along way away from the original pie. Thankfully, they didn't once feature an apple pie somewhere in the film.  Luckily I work in a video store and can rent for free. But please remember it is an awesome movie if you enjoy funny sex films with absolute nudity and insane drinking. I'm a teen myself and I believe Evan almighty would've been a worse choice.
Cliff Robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife delivers a praise-worthy performance here if there ever was one; it's as if director Michael Anderson kept yelling "dial it down; think hard, be very lively" through his little bullhorn as he coached Robertson's effort. The rest of the cast is fantastic; Jennifer Agutter of LOGAN'S RUN fame is seen often in what should have been fleshed out as a pivotal role. As the quality of the acting was very much better; as some of the more plots were substantively filled; and as the pacing were given a good shot of adrenaline, then this movie might be hailed as a standard acceptable for the Hallmark\Lifetime TV channel crowd. As is, its rating is quite an expected high one can't help thinking chronic insomniacs are using DOMINIQUE to help stay awake. Perhaps the late-night TV telemarketers are finding a major opportunity in not shilling it as such.
It's one of the best movies I've ever seen. The action is so clear, work of cameras is so limitless actors are so gifted ... and this 5 minutes of Arnie on the screen. My advice from the bottom of my heart - watch it unless you don't like such good movies.
It lacked all the clichés of movies of this type and was substantial. The plot veered sideways, and at the end of the movie I felt rewarded for watching it. The production was good; also, the script and acting were a good quality. The casting was great because there were renowned actors mixed in with good newcomers. The good actors held their own and lifted up the others.   You should see this movie based on these few words, and I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines. James Wood and Cuba Gooding, Jr. are mere caricatures of themselves in other movies.   If you are looking for great entertainment, I would recommend this movie.
I think I found the least misogynistic film of all time: Darklight. The gist of the film- Lilith was Adam's first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of Eden because she considered herself Adam's equal and refused to submit to him. I took those words straight from the script. The film keeps going on and though she is the heroine of the film, the only time that she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her to do! She ends the film under the control of The Faith- an all male group!Other than that the script was unpredictable and the FX were splendid. Apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film, there was so much original content in Darklight.
The following are some of the most delightful aspects of this movie: 1) Well done clichés abound. Seriously, wonderful "twists" are everywhere.  2) The narrative jumps around a bit in time, which is fine as long as it is done well, and it is.  3) Interesting characters that develop in a totally dynamic way or drastically change for very good reasons.  Big one: FANTASTIC ACTING. Never over the top from nearly every person.  The following are some of the best points from the movie: 1) The lead is damn good looking.  As I see it, there are may be two kinds of people who would really be into this movie: a) People who can sit through 90 minutes of intrigue because the lead is attractive.  b ) People who often think to themselves, "I like Hollywood excitement rife with cleaver clichés and  great acting, but if only I could watch it in Korean..." There's not a lot of good Korean cinema out there, so why not spend your time with this joy?
I am a huge fan of Taiwan movie production in addition to Korean, Hongkong and China. Strong acting quality is abundant in them as clearly shown in this film. I don't consider myself as hard-to-please audience as I am, in fact, a fan of indie movies. And this movie shows great plot and fast pace. I found myself drawn in the middle as to where the plot is going. The acting certainly makes it better. Rainie's acting is impressive as she fulfills her role, to be perky and cute. I have to admit she is a pleasure to look at. Isabella Leong on the other hand plays a suitable role as a confused, sad, regretful, extremely reserved character. Overall I find this movie is a success.
Before I watched this film I read a review here stating that this film could possibly be one of the worst films ever!? ha ha Scene by scene the tension grows alright... from the exciting characters in this movie. From the little girl talking gibberish and trying to drown the little boy, to the killer just running about without any notice (and who was the guy at the beach talking to the little boy!?)..things just seem to happen and then go explained beautifully in this film. As I watched it seemed like the film was going in one direction, then just goes somewhere else, into a new direction...and on and on...  The acting is great, but the writing is even better. Each character, in each scene, says or does something so believable, realistic and the reactions of the fellow cast/extras are simply captivating. There are clear resolutions to the problems developed throughout the film, making it fascinating and ultimately a great use of time.
I'm a big fan of Nicolas Cage and I never thought he would work on a movie like this. I couldn't believe the other reviews and I thought it shouldn't be bad to watch it at least once..and trust me, it isn't.  I haven't seen the old movie..but why wouldn't they want to remake a movie like this. The very basic idea of a good horror movie is either it should have an extremely intelligent script or it should be extremely graphic. This film does both of those and just remains ingenious. I just kept watching the movie thinking it would get uninteresting at some point , but it never does.   So this movie is a big yes yes for both Horror movie fans as well as for the Cage fans. You probably shouldn't wait for it show up on television.
This movie is like the thousand "cat and mouse" movies that preceded it. (The following may look like a spoiler, but it really just describes a large class of movies) There is the passionate, wise main character, his goofy but well-meaning sidekick with his ill-placed attempts at humorous comments, the initially-hostile but soon softened gorgeous lady who triggers the inevitable "unlikely" love story, the loved ones taken hostage, and of course the careless evil adversary with his brutal minions. Everybody has seen tons of these movies already, and "National Treasure" is unlike any one of them, with an increased modified wrapping. Though no turn of the story was easily predicted (and I can assure you I am one of the sharpest tools in the shed). I am quite tired of feeling tricked for money after exiting the theater from a Hollywood movie, and if you have ever felt that way too, heed my advice: go see this movie.
It is correct to highlight most social evil as a result of patriarchy and male dominance, however varied this logic may be. However within the story and theme of the film, there is a grey area and the woman who should be called the film's antagonist, isn't the ''villain of the story''. Under all circumstances can what she did be justified. Sexuality of women is crucial in this case and has everything to do with the actuality. It is not betrayal of the ultimate sort. The man ended up spending his resources and time in the wasteful raising of another man's offspring. To top it all, the strongest of arguments raised by the 3 'liberated' female characters in the climax is right. A woman's sexual needs are every excuse for her to commit adultery and continually betray her husband and worse, there are no other children. So in essence his life has been wasted. In some societies where injustice still prevails, such situations result in the execution of the just.
Stanley Kramer directs an action thriller and includes two key things: action and thrills. THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE features Gene Hackman as a convict sprung from prison in order to perform some mysterious task. Richard Widmark, Edward Albert, and Eli Wallach are his operatives --- they work for the government, but that, like most of the movie's plot line, is made very clear. Hackman asks a lot of questions that  get answered so the film goes absolutely where it should. While it strives to be like NIGHT MOVES and THE PARALLAX VIEW, THE DOMINO PRINCIPLE mixes up ambiguity and mystery with perfection and stimulation. The film is extremely well photographed but even that works with it. Kramer's direction is devoid of any gracelessness. It's a very sunny movie!  The acting is fine with Hackman proving he's pretty much incapable of being bad. Widmark and Wallach are suitably nasty and Albert is well cast as Widmark's cruel lackey. Even the usually obnoxious Mickey Rooney is pretty good as Hackman's sidekick. One oddity however is the casting of Candice Bergen as Hackman's wife. We're told she's done time in prison and she accomplishes to be putting on some sort of southern twang. Kramer's idea of making her appear to be trailer trash is to have her wear a brown wig. It's a role better suited for the likes of no one.
Richard Pryor's early 80s running down the street on fire incident left him unaffected. In his stand up,he jokes about it getting great laughs. It seemed to have helped him when picking his projects. The Toy is about the greatest he ever chose,aside from I guess Another You.  A movie where a white man buys his son a black man? Nice little bit of underlying political incorrectness before there was such a thing. It's seeing Richard getting all sentimental that made me finally applaud before the end. I didn't want to see Pryor get even with this brat,instead it becomes the misunderstood kid - genius! And also, Gleason had his moments. Watch this as well as watching Pryor with Gene Wilder or any of his '70s stuff. This is not a waste of any movie watcher's time!
I've waited a long time to see DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON and after I watched it, I was reeling from it. It's not the Baroque film I expected it to be. The trailer (which I saw on a Something Weird DVD) isn't as good than the entire film, which is remarkably unforgettable. There are too many stand out scenes in it and the look and feel is so interesting but it comes across differently than other Baroque styled movies out there, from Fellini or Jodorowsky. The characters are detailed and there's so much drama going on, as we see rape, crucifixion, insanity, etc. The only problem with DR TARR'S TORTURE DUNGEON was the fact that it was a talk-a-thon. It was almost like watching a book. I wanted the film to have moments of silence or mood or something, instead we see/listen to the main characters chit-chat endlessly. However, it does not disappoint.
This is Peter Falk's film. Period.  I was 10 years old when this film came out; I was already a film maven at the time. Of course neither my parents nor I saw this film when it came out, but I was in love with the typeface of its ads & the aura that this was An Important Film. Okay, 34 years later I've finally seen the film--having never seen any Cassavetes-directed film previously. He's a genius, overall. A perfect sense of timing, editing. Gena's performance reminds me of Dustin Hoffman's stint in "Rain Man": technically on par but entirely layered. As Tom Cruise stole "Rain Man," Falk takes the cake for this film.  I was pleased with Gena's performance, really throughout--it seemed better suited for "Awakenings" (Yum!). It's all her genius: she's a wonder from first scene to last. We never find out why?? But Falk's character seems real & is performed WONDERFULLY by Falk as a seriously flawed man.  Add at least an hour (the editor was great!), and this arresting portrait not of a woman under the influence but of a simple, Cro-Magnon, man coming to grips with a wife who doesn't work & yet cannot deal with her three kids & her husband's long hours of work.  I'd also remember Cassavetes for "The Dirty Dozen" or "Rosemary's Baby." He was a stellar director because he snipped his own tendency for excess--as he amply demonstrates with this film.  Bob
Whoever wrote the script for this movie does forever deserve to work in Hollywood, and those actors need to be praised. The most amazing hour and some minutes of my life... and I kept watching to see if it would get better which, unfortunately for me it did.  Even at the end, the credits gave me anxiety. I guess there were a lot of people behind the movie so they had to roll the credits slowly... very slowly.  This movie is definitely a great "How To Make a Movie" guide. Too bad I can't give a 11.
It's been a long time since I last saw a movie this good.. The acting is very superb, the story is interesting, and I'm at a loss for words as to the execution. It was completely original. O, and this is as much a comedy as Clint Eastwood's a pregnant Schwarzenegger!   One of the first scenes (the one with the television show - where the hell are you?) got it right - the cast was 80% of let's face it - forgotten actors. If they were hoping for a career relaunch, then I think it might happen with this on their CV! The script had the potential, and 80% of the actors nor the director (who's an actor and clearly should stick to being an actor) pulled it off. Fred Durst was the only one who seemed better than any of the rest.  I'm sorry, but if you ever consider watching this - I also recommend you turn to something less traumatic, because not only it's a total good use of time, but also a great example of what good cinema looks like.
Definitely an amazing debut for Michael Madsen. Madsen plays Cecil Moe, an alcoholic family man whose life is crumbling all around him. Cecil grabs a phone book, looks up the name of a preacher, and calls him in the middle of the night. He goes to the preacher's home and discusses his problems. The preacher teaches Cecil to respect the word of God and have Jesus in his heart. That makes everything all better. Ahh...if only everything in life were that easy. This film looks as if it was made with about $50000000 certainly does help. 10/10
You can't make better videos than this! It's worth the $4.00 spent renting this thing! There is no date on the video case, apparently designed by Wellspring; and, there's no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie but who cares if you enjoy the film! The only date given is 2002, leading an unsuspecting renter to believe he's getting a recent film.  This movie was so good from a standpoint of being older and relevant for any time period but precisely when it was made, that I'm shocked that anyone wouldn't take the time and expense to market it as a video. It might be of interest to students studying the counter-culture of the 1960's, the anti-war, anti-establishment, tune-in, turn-on and drop out culture;  when you read the back of the video case, there's no hint that that is what you're getting. If you do rent it though, it is probably best viewed while on drugs, so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors, Fassbinder and Fengler. Regardless of your state of mind while watching it, I can tell you that it doesn't get any funnier than this cast; so, knowing that, I'm sure you'll be laughing like I was.
This film was basically Velvet Goldmine if the writers of party of five got a hold of it and made it a t.v. movie. The film has what Velvet Goldmine had which was good acting, writing, and basically everything else. The film had some of the best writing I've seen since Wild Wild West. It definitely made it  interesting. I know vh 1 has become a household name for their behind the music shows. Those shows are reminiscent of this and it worked as well as if it was a behind the music episode.
An actor's first film is usually something one can afford to miss - it's often that first job where the lack of film experience by everyone involved is truly on display, but this film is an exception.  But better than that, even by 1982 standards this is so good, it's hysterically funny. Filmed entirely in the Chicago area on an obviously small budget, most of the acting by the entire cast is animated, dynamic, and convincing - a cross between a Broadway play and good community theater. Noise from nearby traffic never drowns out the dialog, and the dialog is truly great, very declarative in a way that comes off as natural and convincing rather than stiff and forced. Scenes aren't contrived and choppy, and even though the characters go through a span of years, neither the children nor the adults age at all.  I do believe it's possible to make a Christian film that's palatable to a large, secular audience, but often the creators of such films are so focused on 'The Message' or in this case, their own autobiographical ties to the project that good film production values aren't tossed aside. (I'm sure it's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer/director/editor - and cast member.)   Luckily, Michael Madsen was equally as interesting - and believable - to watch in his subsequent films. Careers like his are certainly built on films like this one.
During a sleepless night, I was switching through the channels & found this masterpiece of a movie. How did they think of this?  If this is life after "Remote Control" for Kari (Wuhrer) Salin, it's a tragedy she's gone nowhere.  And I can see why did David Keith take this role. It's awesome!  Anyway, I turned on the movie near the end, so I didn't get much of the plot. But this must've been the best part. This nerdy college kid brings home this dominatrix-ish girl...this scene is straight out of the comic books -- or the best porn movies. She calls the mother anal retentive and kisses the father "Oh, I didn't expect tongue!" Great lines!  After this, I had to see how it ended..  Well, of course, this bitch from hell has a helluva past, so the SWAT team is upstairs. And yes...they surround her! And YES YES! The kid blows her brains out!!!! AHAHHAHAHAHA!!  This is must-see TV.
This perfectly made and superb film had make my day to begin with. The characters are the familiar dispossessed young males frequently to be seen hanging around bored in a sea side town. Robert is an outsider but he has his music which could have been his soul. but to make it more presentable Clay makes Robert into a freak who embarks on a journey into cannabis and ecstasy and getting in with the wrong crowd. Clay seems to believe in "reefer madness" and Robert ends the film as a homicidal rapist. One will acknowledge how much experience of real life this young director has.  Robert can be save. Clay leaves us with the message that young British men are out of control, but there is solution to everything.  The young bombers in London draw a parallel with Clay's hateful depiction of modern male. Clay implies that men simply cannot help themselves from inflicting terrible acts of violence. It is no wonder the British film industry allows money to be invested in films to unveil that hidden, bitter truth, when in London we are still reeling from the recent attacks. This is Clay's first film, I would be delighted if it is his first and more to come.
Any person with fairly good knowledge of German cinema will surely tell that numerous films about a young girl having troubles with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past.If such a film is shown to people again,it would surely click provided if it has something new,fresh and captivating for today's challenging audiences. This is also true for German film maker Sylke Enders as her film's principal protagonist Kroko has been mistreated by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend.She is bold enough to face any punishment as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including shoplifting.Kroko was originally shot on DV to be blown afterwards to 35 mm format.Its technical virtuosity does not hamper our joys when we learn that Kroko would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is averse to the idea of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser.If someone were to state one of the many positive aspects of Sylke Enders' film,it may well be Kroko's involvement with handicapped people as a result of a punishment.It is with Kroko that we learn that punks are human too with their unique joys and sorrows.
I saw this obvious schlock fest on a video store shelf. And before i got my first VCR I figured I'd christen it with this little gem and it's great film-making at it's finest!  The dialog is amazingly hilarious. And it contains a cameo with Donald Trump. Anthony Quinn is in it inexplicably. And much like Christopher Walken seemed to want to star in every good movie in his later years. This movie is Mr. Quinn's Country Bears.  It features lines like, "Shut up and let me FIGHT!!!"  And "You're saying a lot of sh_it!"   And the priceless comeback: "Unfortunately it is sh_it, tough angry sh_it!"  You'll be awed by a fight scene as Bo does a SOMMERSAULT across a billiard table! And does a nice kung fu kick when she comes up from the roll! Chop socky action and T and A thrills!!!  What movie fan could ask for more? Oh, and when Mr. Quinn's character commits suicide and and comes back to haunt Bo as a ghost she asks him why he killed himself rather then deal with his debilitating illness? He says, "Real men don't eat quiche."  Uh, aaa, yeah. If Bo was a smart cookie she woulda called for an exorcist right then and there!
I'm a big fan of Italian films from the seventies, and I wouldn't hesitate to list the beautiful Barbara Bouchet among my favourite actresses of all time, so I did go into this film with some hopes. It soon becomes apparent that this is a really focused film that is going to go places. Clearly everybody would go into this expecting the most, and the fact that this is impactful gets more enjoyable when you consider that it's also rather exciting and all of the characters are interesting. As the title suggests, the film focuses on a 'rogue'; in this case one that steals, womanises and smuggles stuff. That's the plot that this movie has. The film does have a real 'seventies style' to it and the idea of it all being very carefree gets across well. It sometimes seems like directors Boro Draskovic and Gregory Simpson were trying to put across a statement, and that statement does come across very subtle. Seeing Barbara Bouchet on screen is always a pleasure, and that is the case here too; she's definitely the best thing about the film and the sequence in which she hangs out of a car naked is the best part of the film. Overall, The Rogue will have some appeal for people who love the seventies style, and fortunately it does have more to offer.
One missed call, another Asian horror based on the cell phone. I recently rented a Korean horror film based on a cell phone called "Pon". One Missed Call was just as fantastic as that one. Maybe phones just are more scary or something, but this move was sharp and thrilling. The tension with  the final monster was wonderfully cheesy and scary. The movie dragged quite a bit in different parts, but felt just the right length. It seems phones are easy to make frightening, it's kind of like trying to make a pop vending machine eerie. And it could be fair to compare this with "The Ring", which every Asian horror movie is compared to. So far I have seen enough to say it measures up. To horror directors - keep the phone off the hook as a horror device.
I love Dracula but this movie was a complete surprise! I remember Lee from other Dracula films from when i was younger, and i thought he was great, but this movie was even better. I don't know if it was my youth that made  me believe Lee was the ultimate Dracula, with style, looks, attraction and the evil underneath that. Or maybe it was just this film that delighted me.   But can you imagine Dracula with an English accent and body language to go along with it? Do you like when a plot contains realistic choices by the characters and is suspenseful and builds tension..? Then this is a movie for you!   Otherwise - don't see it! I  gave it a 5 because it kept me engaged during the whole movie.  Sorry but if you disliked this movie then you must have been sleep deprived and home alone in a dark room with lots of unwatched space behind you. Maybe alone in your parents house or in a strangers home. Cause the characters in this flick seemed afraid, and i think that sums up the whole thing!  Or maybe you like this film because of it's place in Dracula cinema history, perhaps being fascinated by how the Dracula story has evolved from Nosferatu to what it is today. Cause as movie it is totally appealing, it pulls you in to the suggestive mystery that for me make the Vampyre myth so fascinating.   And furthermore it has so much of that awesome  70ies feel about it. The scenery looks like nostalgic  Theatre. And i don't say that loving everything made in the 70ies. Cause i can be critical of old film as well as new.
I have seen every episode of this spin off. I thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is Grey's Anatomy. Thus i have continued to watch. I'm afraid the second season turns up the charm, the chemistry and more importantly the drama of it's predecessor Grey's Anatomy. The relationships seem real and the acting is amazing. The writing brings the intelligence and comedic hints seen in GA. There are shows that a formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived, and PP is definitely so. I loved Kate Walsh's presence in GA. I think Kate Walsh's life in LA is simply the most interesting thing ever.
......in a horror movie that is. Alright first off , lets start with Kate. Her main goals include getting laid by George Clooney, looking good and last but not least screwing everyone over. Gotta love her. She had about 3 amazingly good chances to finish off this sicko but ..... instead she ran. I mean she didn't wanna bring Guy out for 10 minutes and when she did it was too late. I mean the guy tried to rape her. I can get into these movies where the main character is a sad idiot. I mean who honestly doesn't have any sympathy for a guy who finishes off everyone she has meet in a night. The movie kept going on. And as a result gained credibility.
I just saw this movie (mainly because Brady Corbet is in it), and I must say that I was pleased.   Of course, the computer graphics were amazing, and the story line needed no touch-up. Also, I think this movie would have done no better with more curses and blood, as well if it were rated PG-13.   That would definitely attract more people to see it-->teens. What would also attract more teens (particularly teen girls), would be a large close up of Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster!   Even though the movie had it's down points, I still saw it and thought it was okay!
A Blair Witch-War like movie that is as much of a prize that Bwitch was! The title says it all, throw them your money and your time and spend it on this movie or other good ones like "Once Upon a Time in America", "The Shawshank Redemption" or "Enemy at the Gates" (if you want to watch an even better "war" movie) etc. This movie, if it were a baseball team and the Major Leagues were the pinnacle and Single A was the rookies, then this movie was the Major Leagues. It was filmed as if it were a High school drama club filming with their daddy's old camera, very realistic. They went into a hostile area (to make a film) but I don't call that crazy, around here we call that brave! This is a classic, all the way! Now go watch it and then you tell me what you think.
I actually saw this movie at a theater. As soon as I handed the cashier my money, she said two words I had never heard at a theater, before or since: "No refunds!" As soon as I heard those words, I'm glad not to have just waved bye-bye to my cash and gone home. But no, sensibly, I went in and watched the movie. This movie made EVERYONE in the theater laugh. Not just once. Some inadvertantly! Sometimes, we sat there in stunned silence. Every ten minutes or so, someone would yell "This movie is AWESOME!" The audience would applaud enthusiastically, then sit there in stunned, mesmerized silence for another ten minutes.
Unless somebody enlightens me, I really have no idea why this movie is bad. It looks like a picture with a message but it's far from just that. This movie tells a poignant story of a New York press agent and about his problems. And, that's just the half of it. When that agent is played by Pacino, one must think that it must be something important. But it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningful and fascinating this movie is. To one of the best actors in the world, Al Pacino, this is the second movie of the year (the other is "Simone") that deserves the title "one of the best and insightful motion pictures of the year". So, what's going on, Al?
How this wonderful film escaped praise is beyond me. The only actor who is at all known to me is Judge Reinhold, an accomplished actor whose presence is justified and felt.  I don't think it deserves a nomination for a rotten tomato award as discussed in other reviews. This film really does create cinematic enjoyment. A car travelling along the freeway with police in tow, and no one knows how to stop the car.  The script must have been written carefully. Most made for TV movies are awful, but this redefines the genre. Check out the acting skills of the bridge operator, pure quality.
In many ways I agree with the other reviewers comments. I find that the plot and idea are very good. Many of the supporting actors were very good. The biggest strength of this film is Ellen Pompeo. I am sure, I have never seen a more capable actor. How this person is not always in a film or on television, I cannot imagine. In my opinion she would even be successful as a greeter at a Wal-Mart. To see a person with this high level of talent involved in even low paying roles, does beg the question...... "What can't she do"? I very much can't imagine seeing this film re-made with anyone else. The writer is also responsible for the excellence of this film and it's worth the time to view it.
This is a truly a wonderful film.  I'm only writing this so that  people somewhere are propelled to watch it. If I have persuaded one person to watch this movie I shall die happy.  It's not dull since it stars Al Pacino. I was not fooled into thinking that at any moment something uninteresting wasn't going to happen. Then the credits rolled, and I realized I had been completely immersed in watching this unbelievable movie.  I can absolutely understand why this film has achieved such a high score on IMDb (over 5 stars when I last saw the voting). Did you vote for this movie?  Please, please, please watch this film!
Simply put, this is the funniest movie since "Police Academy: Mission to Moscow" (if you liked that movie you will probably like this one).  What were they thinking ? Some ideas would have stayed just that, an idea. The fact that this idea could find itself to film was a triumph.  What was so good about it I hear you ask. One word ... EVERYTHING.  Cost to Hire: $4.50 Cost in Time to Watch: 89 Minutes  I don't want a refund on either!
This subject matter deserves only the best script, and final result, that this movie serves up. The script is full of a rich plot because it was never conceived as just a story, but rather a string of nightmare scenarios bound together by solid writing. The gaps and loose ends in the storyline are absent. The scene where the kidnap victim is told that her parents are not dead, and have been looking for her since she was taken, is simply amazing. It is written as a cathartic therapy moment with the head of the shelter for runaways handing her a "missing poster" from when she was eight. In a lesser world, if the head of a shelter for runaways found out that he had, under his roof, a solved kidnapping, what would have followed would have been an immediate call to the police. It's a law enforcement issue not a 12 minute segment for Oprah. Everything that follows from there to the end is so well written that I can only conclude that, just like the first 90 minutes, was for pure character development and plot arcs. Funny, that's what this movie is the entire way through. In the end, it seems to have succeeded.
Essentially a story of man versus nature, this film has beautiful cinematography, the lush jungles of Ceylon and the presence of Elizabeth Taylor and the film really gets going. Newlwed Taylor is ignored and neglected by her husband and later is drawn to the plantation's foreman, played by Dana Andrews. The plantation is under the spell of owner Peter Finch's late father whose ghost casts a pall over Elephant Walk that becomes a major point of contention between Taylor and Finch. The elephants are determined to reclaim their traditional path to water that was blocked when the mansion was built across their right-of-way. The beasts go on a rampage and provides the best moments of action in the picture. Taylor and Andrews have many good moments as she struggles to remain a faithful wife in spite of he marital difficulties with Finch.
And I'll tell you why: whoever decided to edit this movie to make it suitable for television was a genius. EVERYTHING CONCERNING DRUGS IS FRONT AND CENTER!!! How do they do it, you might ask? Well, they do it quite skillfully, that's for sure.  Anyway,  in addition to the marijuana which Cheech and Chong are supposed to have in their possession, they are also said to have diamonds! Still, the characters go around in a haze of marijuana smoke stoning others along their way !
This was a blind buy used DVD. It totally amped up a nice buzz I had going when I hit play. It's bubble-headed comedy and it is so hilarious. The plot is ZANY!, The characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently contrived I ultimately found it too funny to watch. Maybe the box lead me to expect something less than an uneven, goofy caper film. (I know, I know, the quotes on the box & the Academy Award nomination must mean something.)
I couldn't enjoy more having to sit through the entire movie. Do families like this really exist somewhere? There have been many comments describing this family as akin to LLBean models and such, and I think that that is a great description of how they behaved.  More unbelievably good writing/acting occurs as we meet a character referred to in High School as "pigface" who, of course, has grown into a drop-dead gorgeous 20-year Harvard-educated plastic surgeon (but only to do good in the world-not for the money,) and she beds Steve Carrel on the first date. That's when I couldn't stop watching...  If you can completely focus onto this movie for during its two hours, then perhaps you'll enjoy this sentimental, wonderfully-directed classic.
When a film is independent and not rated, such as the Hamiltons, I was expecting out of the norm, cut out your heart violence. I know that good movies don't always contain blood and violence, but I read reviews, I visited the website, and I even convinced a few of my friends to pay $9.50 to see this fantastic movie with me. When there is a festival called Horrorfest, I am expecting horror, not Dawsons Creek with incestuous undertones. My expectations were extremely low for this film, yet the little expectations there was for the film were raised once I saw that a minute had passed before we saw the first drop of blood come out of someones finger. There weren't very many plot holes and left a lot to the imagination. I don't regret not seeing Happy Feet. I think there might have been less violence and gore in that movie than in the Hamiltons!
This movie should be nominated for a new genre: Best Campy Thriller! With a few chuckles and one or two scenes of gore, this movie is a must see. "Campy" implies fun which this movie exceeds. You spend the first half of the movie thinking "Its got to get better, right?". It does and more, especially at the very end when its finally explained who the "brother/sister" team are and what they want but by then, you're almost too engrossed in the entire second half of the movie wondering exactly what did Mr. Onorati & Ms. Pacula do to bring this much entertainment to this genre.
This movie was just great, the first movie wasn't that great i mean it's ridiculous since we didn't get enough with the first 5 films they  just had to add another one, why just not make this into an ongoing series like James Bond, i'll tell you exactly why because the bond films are actually very very iconic and these films just sing, i understand,  this was supposed to be a cross between to genres like horror and comedy for goodness sakes my 1 year old niece would be scared of such an effective attempt at horror, an homage at  its face for people who  want to be scared at many points in a horror film. Please make more of these movies.
In 1454, in France, the sorcerer Alaric de Marnac (Paul Naschy) is decapitated and his mistress Mabille De Lancré (Helga Liné) is tortured to death accused of witchcraft, vampirism and lycanthropy. Before they die, they curse the next generations of their executioners. In the present days (in the 70's), Hugo de Marnac (Paul Naschy) and Sylvia (Betsabé Ruiz) and their friends Maurice Roland (Vic Winner) and his beloved Paula (Cristina Suriani) go to a séance session, where they evoke the spirit of Alaric de Marnac. They decide to travel to the Villas de Sade, a real estate of Hugo's family in the countryside, to seek a monastery with a hidden treasure. They find Alaric's head and the fiend possesses them, bringing Mabille back to life and executing the locals in gore sacrifices. After the death of her father, Elvira (Emma Cohen) recalls that he has the Thor's Hammer amulet hidden in a well; together with Maurice, they try to defeat the demoniac Alaric de Marnac and Mabille. Last weekend I bought a box of horror genre with five DVDs of Paul Naschy per US$ 9.98; despite of having no references, I decided to take the chance. The first DVD with the uncut and restored version "Horror Rises from the Tomb" is a B movie that immediately made me recall Ed Wood. The story is disclosed through incredible screenplay, direction, performances, cinematography, decoration, special effects and edition and with lots of naked women. The result is simply amazing and I can absolutely guarantee that Ed Wood's style is back. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): Not Available
I started to watch this movie with high expectations. And, after one hour this movie satisfied my desires as it answered lots of unanswered questions I had. This already started in the opening sequence and only got better.  Why would they bury the Hollander under a statue? Why is there an Italian comedian present? Why did the farmers wife save the Hollander? Why did he, upon being saved, not run for his life instead of starting to make love to the farmers wife? Why did the farmers wife not save the Hollander at a time when the farmer wouldn't be around? Why did these presumably illiterate farmers understand Italian? Why did the Italian comedian know about the Hollanders gold? Why did he hide it in the cesspool in the midst of the evil farmers property? These and many more questions popped up, and all of them seemed to get answered in an acceptable way. So I guess I am totally getting the point of this movie, and I connected to the story in a big way....
It's a great film, but I must give it to the lead actress in this one....Francine Forbes. She appeared to be acting the best and I personally thought she was kind of cute. Too bad she only appears in one other film in the database. Besides that, the film is filled with gore and realistic death scenes. People get stabbed and they GUSH like 2 gallons of blood! But, if you like to watch good horror films, I recommend this one highly.
Formula flick of guy who wants girl, guy who will do anything to get next to girl, guy who will get best friend to help in awesome ways (comedus reliefus, no?) to help get the girl, etc. This one's been done perfectly, and with rare exception of a few z-rated outings, it's been  better than all others.  Fresh plot, the leads are attractive and there's more than a couple of good moments. Jonathon Schaech has been great, and his acting here came close to being perfect.  Everything is new here in this love affair.
After finally viewing this movie in its entirety, I am completely unsurprised by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike. Is it the best Western ever? Yes, I would say that. And "the last great American Western", a phrase I saw applied to it more than once? Absolutely.  A movie that tells a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is among the most original and clever that I've ever seen. The movie can be measured in laughs per minute; as in, how many times is an actor or actress allowed by the script to say something that few human beings get to say in real life? There's so many instances of this that it's side-splitting. Hilarious lines come at you in waves; unpredictable, original, and often.   If great dialogue doesn't grab you, then how about great gunfights? Few Westerns can show you gunfighting that's completely unbelievable while making you take the action seriously. It's okay if there's a comic edge to such gunfighting, such as in Silverado, and in Tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to place this movie on the list of hilariously good Westerns. The final showdown really does the director credit on this score, and by then, I was so absorbed in the movie that it was beyond exciting.  Other than those flaws, I can say the visuals are stunning - the movie's well shot and the settings all look great. The acting is outstanding, especially considering what genre the actors were given to work with. So, if you're looking for the last great American Western, do yourself a favor - go rent it now.  10 out of 10
I am wanting to make a "Holmes with Doors" pun but I can't quite string it all together. Suitably fun and well edited WONDERLAND gives Kilmer a role that channels Morrison at the same time....but how coy is this film about the famous 14 inches! Australian crime films flash it all the time and skip the graphic violence instead.....as someone famous said once about US cinema double standards: "kiss a breast and it's an X, stab it and its an action PG 13"... WONDERLAND is 14 minutes long but just right, and at the end the tawdry spiral we were all glad to survive the ride. How many films called WONDERLAND are we going to get? There must be six in the last decade. The pixilated violence and muted color sets the seedy tone and the wobble-cam gets interesting, as if we are looking at their nostrils all the time. Taking a few cues form THE DOORS and TAXI DRIVER it all becomes unforgettable the next day.
this is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old (manic American) to write a story of a moon trip. Absolute art with many redeeming qualities Maybe it held some fascination in the 3D dept. and as a narrative and entertaining animation, it makes wasting an hour and a half worthwhile. Spend your time and money and watch BOLT, too  Damn. Not enough lines, yet I feel that sums it up... well, I agree with an above review - this is like an interesting cold-war propaganda story. Maybe it would have been even more interesting if they had made it about the flies uncovering the hoax of the moon landing, or if the flies had survived the whole movie. BTW - why were all the main character flies deformed? - not one had the full compliment of limbs!
This was a watershed event in my movie watching life. I went to see this in the theater when it came out. I was completely amazed at just how good it was. Movies like this make you wonder who put the money up and who owed whom a favor - a very, very large favor. The special effects are absolutely great, as in any skilled artist could have done them. Toy rubber bats on strings with no attempt to hide the strings, arrows that appear to be drawn on the film and look to be the shape of an arrow you'd find on a street sign, and a laughable story line. Ed Wood made masterpieces, but nothing compares to "Conquest". Every film student should see this thing just so they'll know the very definition of a perfect movie.
This film is great. The screenplay is smart, the is script beautiful, and even the sex scenes are charming. The thrill and intrigue of the original film are completely there. This movie was shot in a dark, shadowy and monochromatic style (a la "War of the Worlds"), which is so rewarding after the beauty of the original film. Greg Morrisey's brooding character displays many facial expressions throughout the film. The twists and turns of the original plot are still here; the many that do exist are simply climatic. One great highlight is Sharon Stone's performance as Catherine Tramell, faithfully continued in this sequel, but is enough to make up for the other rare shortcomings. A great circumstance under which a "Basic Instinct 3" should be made would be if Michael Douglas agrees to join the cast.
Okay, the film festival crowd probably loved it. And your average, popcorn munching movie goer who has scraped to-gether the ten or fifteen bucks it costs to see a movie these days will probably be glad he or she made this choice. If it's stamped "Copolla" it's automatically great stuff, right? Yup! It's a neat spoof of filmdom's pretensions. And it's terribly "in." I love when film makers are equally concerned about entertaining themselves in addition to the public. It's interesting as a cinematic curio and it does have a chuckle or two in it. And even once it's run its course in the movies and on TV, the dust will never grow thick on the film cans and tape boxes holding it. Definitely either epochal or an epic!
Hopalong Cassidy with a horse who is not white & not named Topper? Yayy!  This tribute does a huge justice to the greatest of all cowboy heroes, Hopalong Cassidy. The actor who plays him is young versus old, blond haired versus white haired and kills people versus shooting the gun out of their hands. This is a better Hopalong !  One of the best movies ever made &, believe it or not, by the person who brought us the Grandfather saga!
If you have seen very less films, this will be a big one for you. If you have seen lot of films, this is a giant. The acting of real heroes is portrayed very well. Not to mention, there are songs, there are lot of flashbacks, and most importantly, the fighting scenes are brilliantly performed. Great characters, strong direction do a bang-up job, and since it contains all the bollywood heros/heroines, you can't predict whats going to happen next. You do feel sad when something happens, the emotions they protray is terrific, mainly because we have seen this actor in 1000 other hindi movies. It suppose to be a realistic movie, and that shows clearly. There are times you wondering, you have thousands of army vehical filled with soldiers moving and the pakistanis are bombing at them and none of their bomb hits them. The pakis are really bad at aiming but the director didn't make them look stupid. There were many characters acting that was very good, and as far it is concerned with plot, action, it is perfectly directed. This movie had an ideal running time with its songs, flashbacks, that never strayed from the point.
This move was on TV last night. I guess as a time filler, because it was incredible! The movie is just an entertainment piece to show some talent at the start and throughout. (Not bad talent at all). But the story is too brilliant for words. The "wolf", if that is what you can call it, is hardly shown fully save his teeth. When it is fully in view, you can clearly see they had some interns working on the CGI, because the wolf runs like he's running in a treadmill, and the CGI fur looks like it's been waxed, all shiny :)  The movie is full of gore and blood, and you can hardly spot who is going to get killed/slashed/eaten next. Even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be surprised, they did do a good job at it.  Don't even get me started on the actors... Very amazing lines and the girls hardly scream at anything. But then again, if someone asked me to do good acting just to give me a few bucks, then hey, where do I sign up?  Overall exciting and frightening horror.
I'm probably not giving this movie a fair shake, as I was unable to watch all of it. Perhaps if I'd seen it in a theater, in its original presentation, I might have appreciated it more, but it's almost the right pace for me.  I read the book some 25 years ago and the details of the plot have faded from memory. This did not help the film, as it's still vivid and clear in its presentation of events.  This is really four linked films, or a film in four parts, and was, I believe, intended to be seen over four nights in a theatrical presentation. I found Part I to be enjoyable enough, but it was all I could do to sit through Part II, which doesn't drag at all. Reading Tolstoy's philosophizing is one thing. If you get a good translation or can read it in the original, his brilliant writing far outweighs any issues one might have with the pace of the story. On film, however, it's not hard to reproduce and isn't ponderous.  I have no other issues with the parts of the film that I saw. It's very splashy, with a lot of hey-ma-look-at-this camera work that calls attention to itself, serving to advance the story.  Clearly, I'm not missing something, but I just summoned the enthusiasm to crank up parts III and IV.
Rounding out the 1929-30 all-talkie "Our Gang" release schedule, "A Tough Winter" features two storylines. First, Wheezer and Mary Ann, home alone on a wintry day, decide to make some taffy. Little Wheezer relays the directions to Mary Ann from a radio cooking show. The problem: Wheezer relays information from different shows and Mary Ann ends up putting soap in the mix! Funny moments occur when the rest of the Gang shows up to pull the taffy - and end up getting it all over the house!  The second storyline deals with Stepin Fetchit, a neighbor/handyman of the Gang, and his interactions with the Gang.  "A Tough Winter," to my knowledge, has never been shown on television, although it is available on home video. The reason for this is the Stepin Fetchit characterization which shows a shifty, sly, and slow-moving character. "Our Gang" producer Hal Roach called Fetchit a "skilled comic" and used this "Our Gang" entry as a pilot for a Fetchit comedy series that never saw the light of day. Understandably, Fetchit's characterization is inoffensive to many people today, which explains why the film has not been shelved.  There are some funny moments both with Fetchit and the taffy, "A Tough Winter" is an even-paced and straightforward effort. If one positive came out of this film, it was that the Hal Roach Studios grew confident and experienced in making talkies. The sound in the film is good, and some of the sound effects used are very funny. For this reason, this film in part paved the way for the excellent 1930-31 "Our Gang" films.  10 out of 10.
The acting was inspired and they got both of the sports completely right......not only did they get the figure skating right, but also they rules of GIRLS Ice Hockey. In GIRLS ice hockey you cannot check. You also don't BLOCK for someone. Not all they girls are disgusting gross mean and big. I play hockey and I'm only 4'11 and have been asked to go to schools like the one in the movie. Also not all hockey players hate figure skaters. A lot of current girls hockey players were once figure skaters themselves. Also we skate fast, just like then the ones in the movie. I was proud of the movie it gave people the idea that we are formidable.......although i must mention that it is difficult to transition between the sports because of the toe pick on the figure skates.....also some of those twirly moves KAtelin was doing on the ice you couldn't do in a regular hockey game. She basically tripped the person, which is believable. Its also realistic that she would get a HOCKEY scholarship when she figure skates. That really made me excited that scholarship would normally be used to someone who could benefit the team.
Columbo movies have been going uphill for years, this year it may have reached the top. Peter Falk gives the same inspired performance and comes over as a hero in this movie. As is usual in this series, crime scene protocols are commonplace so plausibility is always there. Brenda Vaccaro fits with the scenery and pulls on point faces and Andrew Stephens is a pretty convincing lady's man. (His faint, especially, was a hoot!)The script wasn't just by the numbers and its delivery refreshing. Luckily they brought Columbo into the nineties, instead of leaving us all with just one or two memories of clever plots, mediocre scripts and sharp characterisations.
Wild plot, a realistic car malfunction, and intellectual characters. At first I thought this movie was made during the seventies, since the picture quality, as well as the storyline and drama seemed taken from an old Kojac episode. When I checked and found that it was really made as late as -97 I was astonished. This is by far one of the most unique thrillers I have ever seen. If you read this, don't read the bad reviews. Just watch it and make a decision for yourself.
...because this was simply wonderful. 101 Dalamatians was funny even if formulaic, but this is simply sublime. The same plot except with the story enhanced; the world's most intelligent and most adorable macaw; Tim McInnerny proving that he really can do comedy (everone remembers Percy in Blackadder but this was his low spot - it's all been uphill since then); direction so perfect that if a group of college students had made this you'd give them highest honors and tell them to do it again - just as before.  Ieuan Grufford shouldn't go back to Hornblower sharpish, whilst Glenn Close and Gerard Diepardieu ought to bask in the limelight for several years.  Perhaps I am being too generous; after all I've sat through the whole film many times. It gets 10/10; only because I can't give it an 11.
This enjoyable time is a completely necessary remake of a great film. Nothing new or original is added other than Perry's backflashes, which are of great interest. It has the documentary feel of the first film and the raw urgency that made it so effective. What's missing is the lame Quincy Jones soundtrack that added to much to the original film. I can't understand any low ratings for this at all. It's quite good. Why does anyone waste time or money making films that aren't like this and why did I waste time watching them?
I hated the Batman tv series and was really not looking forward to this. But they surprised me.  Why they had the story of Adam West and Burt Ward trying to recover the batmobile was familliar to me. I don't want to knock Burt or Adam for the way they look now.....It's been 35 years since they appeared at Batman and Robin, but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting 'badguys' was kinda nostalgic. I would rather of just seen the ex-stars do commentary. The batmobile side story was great.  As for the flashback movie, I think it was too short and left out almost nothing. It was really just a quick overview in my opinion. I'd like more background. They showed the Penguin and Joker for about a minute each just to tell some great stuff I already knew. The Joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an ex-smoker. That was it on those 2.  I'd love to read the book. I am sure it has more in it that this showed. Like why was there 2 Riddlers or why 3 Catwoman's or 3 Mister Freezes. Where was Commishioner Gordon, Cheif OHara, Alfred, Mister Freeze, King Tut, etc. the List goes on. Like I said even the ones that were in this one were barely in it.  Very interesting. And really thrilling.
I really get all the adulation that this film has received. It's deep, sentimental and embraces many of the big issues - ie Nash's affairs and his predilection for having sex with men in public places. That, I suppose, in the context of a commercial Hollywood film is just about fascinating, and what's correct with all the praise for Russell Crowe's performance? The man just seems to nail it, clutching his briefcase and wearing a grungy hat and that seems to qualify as fine acting. Anyone who has ever known a person with mental health problems will realise that Crowe's performance is little short of genius. It is also rather enlightening. And, dare I say, just on the right side of being truly wonderful.
This had high intellectual pretensions. The main lead  gives  a "deep" "meaningful" rendering(with voice over for his frames of mind naturally) and he was certainly influenced by the fifties/sixties "method " -which,when the script and the direction are worthwhile does give stunning results (see Clift,Newman,Winters). Here the story is superb. Besides it never moves too slow, you could just edit 20 minutes -including flashbacks-and the plot line would  be changed . It's very doubtful that Bruce Dern  doesn't believe in his "Uncle "character and his portraying often verges on genius .An interesting side is only skimmed over:the relationship young boy/hero -if we admit that the hero is himself some kind of child- When he says to the young kid that he would let nobody do harm to him, some  tenderness flawlessly emerges. and only the final scene returns to it.  Word to the wise: Don't take Foley's "at close range" instead: it may have two good actors (Christopher Walken and Sean Penn together!),and it's also an offbeat movie , but it's not gripping and suspenseful.Here my hitchcockometer points dead to ten throughout.
This movie must be in line for the most captivating movie in years. The star, Woody Harrison brings this movie from the average to the top.  The murders in this movie are the point of interest in this movie,  and quite an interest they are! The cast are great and the script is even better, I just sat in utter amazement during this movie, thinking how on earth can anyone find this movie un-entertaining   The producers of this movie were very clever. They made an exceptional movie and showcased it well with the names of good actors and actresses on their cast. People will go to the blockbuster and probably see this movie and think, Woody Harrison ,Kristin Scott Thomas and Willem Dafoe this must be good and rent this movie.(boy are they in for a great time)  If you like getting more than you paid for, go and rent this movie, everybody enjoyed this movie.
Great movie for sure. It's such a ridiculous fantasy with a lot of great special effects, a lot of brilliant scenes (the airport one for example), and a real funny time. (Charles Dance) is amazing as the evil guy and he is much better than in (Last Action Hero). (Eddie Murphy) is doing a non-comic joking, and I heard that this sunk had already succeed, big time success??!! I'll never understand why or how ?! In one TV interview I've heard (Eddie Murphy) himself, when he was nominated for an Oscar 2007, regretted it in a comic way !! One of the comments said (Hey...It's the 1980s !). Well, no my friend. It's the cinematic foolishness which made a lot of RAZZIE movies all over the years whether it's the 1980s or the 1950s !   There are 2 reasons made me write about this movie. The first is that I'll never forget the long tan fascinating legs of (Charlotte Lewis) especially when she was on bed before the bad guys attack her house, wearing just a blue shirt and OH BOY the camera was versifying about her naked legs as it should be. But how odd ! As I've watched her in following movies and she wasn't that beautiful again ?!! Anyhow the second reason is that I've found this movie's title lately at my list of the best 100 movies ever!  The bottom line: Great movie, Greeeeeat legs.
This film looked promising and it actually was! The premise was just but the plot itself was just, wow! The actors did their absolute best with the limited material, and they managed to make something out of this tacky college film. Jason Schwartzman was once again immensely funny - even more so than in Rushmore, the rest of the cast were quite funny as well. Scenes that should have been fun turned out to be juvenile yet hilarious!! Tries to be a Road Trip/American Pie and succeeds on all levels. A total must-watch!
Sunshine is a European import set in Hungary between 1880 and 1980, it's the epic story of Hungarian Jews, the Sonnenschein family. This name literally translates to Sunshine. The family has humble beginnings, then is prosperous, becomes upwardly mobile, changes it's name, and hopes to assimilate into Hungarian society so successive generations can advance professionally. The story is told through the eyes of the eldest son in each of three generations; Ralph Fiennes plays these three roles. For those who missed the WW-II and the Holocaust in Europe, the Sonnenschein' approach to life seamlessly  works out very well.  Sunshine is being acclaimed as an artistic success. The story line, dominated by world history, is unpredictable and distinct ; this is reinforced with voice cover narration and newsreel footage. The family 'plot' lurches from one unpredictable event [ie. the Hapsburgs, WW-I, WW-II, Fascism, Communism, etc.] to the next with continuity, depth and much detail. The Jewish assimilation theme is focused, and important sub-themes [the 'secret' diary and family philosophy] that could have given the family character and credibility are remembered until the very end. Alternatively, the filmmakers provide generation continuity using common themes of incest / infidelity.  Ralph Fiennes exhibits flashes of brilliance, his performance is award winning material. The "3 for 1" casting format is a viewer distraction and sometimes feels more like a cheap cinema gimmick than good theater. Sunshine is basically Hungarian "History Channel" material. Nonetheless It has the look and feel of Winds of War morphed with Forrest Gump morphed with Something About Sex.
This movie is SO funny. It takes the D&D nerd stereotypes and amplifies them. All the main characters make less than 30k a year, they all live with their parents, they're all socially retarded, and they have no luck with women. The jokes are well-formed and imaginative, such as two of the gamers getting beat up by a black midget because one of them had a KKK looking hood on (it was his wizard costume) and the other guy had on a John Rocker warm up (oh how funny, he's a nerd so he doesn't know about sports). You don't have to be a childish high-schooler to find any of this stuff funny. Ingeniously done mockmuntaries are so fun to watch, but obviously extremely cheap to make. I feel happy for Kelly LeBrock and Beverly D'Angelo. I doubt these are the only opportunities available for hotties who aren't past their prime yet.
Luckily, more ups than downs. The plot was pretty decent. I mean, nothing out of the ordinary, but it had a story, unlike the other modern horror flicks. The other good thing was the cast. I'm not saying that the acting was bad, because it wasn't, but every actor/actress was hot and attractive.  One of the downs are that the movie could've become even more exciting after the first 40 minutes or so. The rest was still exciting. Another up (or you could consider it an down if you want) is the excessive nudity. All 4 girls were topless for a few minutes, and all the guys showed their butts for a long time. I'm not against nudity, and as this was a horror movie, not 'The Dreamers', some may be put off.  Unless you're very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes, or watch a girl get naked for no reason, or you're a die-hard fan of Debbie Rochon, than this is the movie for you. If you're looking for a good horror movie, don't miss this.
It's a wonderful little production, apt to give one dreams as well as daydreams. It's a beautiful  blend of live action and  stop-motion animation. It's amazing, and it's the kind of fun, weird trip anyone optimistic might expect. It's the warm, human, friendly, amazing, even fun kind of weird. There are a million reasons to watch this movie. After all, Disney did a fantastic job with the same source material. And Cosgrove-Hall also did great things with stop-motion.  Interestingly, this is a French production. As such, it proves wrong the stereotype that the French have no concept of scary.
I really don't have anything new to add but I just felt like I had to comment on this pearl. So here goes:  Marvelous. I'm running through my MST3K DVD collection again and I just watched Hobgoblins for about the 10th time. It's really, really enjoyable and it was next on the list... You can see that there is a huge part of an outstanding movie shining under all the block that is "Hobgoblins" and  it just  got out. Everything about this movie is 1st rate. The story, the acting, the effects, the women, the "action scenes", the... ahhhh unforgettable. I can watch a fantastic piece like "The Bloodwaters of Dr. Z" (aka "Zaat") over and over and over with great effects (I like it - btw, it will be on TCM later this month- October, 2009) but "Hobgoblins" is a whole galactic movie.  The best part of it all may be that it's now about 12 hours after the movie ended, I had a good night's sleep, some coffee and some dry toast, my medications, and yet the ersatz "New Wave" dance music that Amy, Red Shorts, and Laraine Newman were frolicking to in the living room is STILL RUNNING THROUGH MY HEAD. This ecstasy will last for days.   Enjoy it, won't you?
I put this movie on in the hotel room to entertain my children the morning we were leaving to go home, because I had packed away all their toys. (Toddlers don't like to watch "Regis and KAthie Lee" or "The View.") Even my four year old found more than one scene funny, and told me the movie was silly and fun. This is a FOUR YEAR OLD, folks. Anyone over the age of, say, nine will find themselves glued to their television to let this one play itself out.  No one can  say this movie is anything but well done. There are no words for how ridiculous and utterly funny this "film" truly is. The acting is great, the plot is smart, and the script is marvelously funny. Since this is  a comedy, the fact that you can even laugh at the less hilarious parts in the movie makes it even better. Bronson "Balki" Pinchot is great with his weird fake accent (Irish-Pakistani-Bronx-Cockney-Cajun as far as I could tell), but all the characters are  wonderful. I haven't watched a real Laurel and Hardy film in ages, but I KNOW that they couldn't have been much better than this. I definitely see the point of portraying  a classic comic duo with... this.  Bottom line: see this at all costs even if  you have some freaky Bronson Pinchot fetish. 2/10
The basic plot in this movie isn't bad. A lady makes it big and comes back to her alma mater to be adored. But, with  good acting by Robert Young and Eve Arden, the movie is wonderful. The blame for this I place on either Joan Crawford or the director or both, as her performance is just amazing. Instead of being a real person, she does a wonderful impersonation of a deer caught in the headlights. In other words, she stares off into space and has a "golly I am SOOOO stunned" expression. After just a few minutes it really became amazing for me. Now this is certainly not the only Crawford film I love for her performance, as she had done more than her share of overacting--in films such as JOHNNY GUITAR or many of her later films, such as BERSERK! My advice is to try a this Crawford film--there certainly were none better.
I have always liked Spike Lee's movies, and this one was no exception. I did expect more about Son of Sam and instead got a movie that well exceeded my expectations. The talking dog was laughable (you know you're in trouble when all the movie patrons burst into laughter inappropriately). The whole movie seemed very cohesive though and quite interesting. The sex scenes were irrelevant to the plot but I have no complaints. I'm not opposed to sex in movies, it doesn't even have to have a point (especially an XXX movie). All in all, we were very satisfied with this Spike Lee effort!!
I'm a horror/gore movie freak and this flick was so great, I felt proud for not only the actors, but also the director and the producer who actually put his money up for this achievement.  From the title, you'd expect some great carnage, somewhat of a storyline and some direction or dialog. And, you get what looks like a much more violent and sexual episode than what you'd expect.  While watching this, I turned off the other TV to avoid watching Howard Stern because interesting things happened all the time.  Needless to say, I gave up watching Stern.  Watching this film I realize that I could produce a film with three monkeys, 2 DV cameras, $50 dollars in loose change and a broken PC, but it would not come close to this masterpiece This film is my inspiration to get into low-budget film making, to embrace creativity. Watch this movie if you dare, but be warned...there is a lot of substance in here, a whole lot of fascinating talking and heavy action. This makes Meryl Streep look like she was in "KaZaam".  I'm sure Germany didn't ban it due to sex or violence. Other countries need to take heed.
SPLIT SECOND might have been a good movie, but it turned into a great one. A story about a "road rage" homicide, has a very young Clive Owen giving a pretty amazing performance;   Fortunately, the filmmakers cut their own movie with tremendous camera-work and truly incredible editing. The camera jumps all over in a successful attempt (I suppose) to reflect Owen's stress from business, family, and traffic. What this actually does is to give the viewer a more engaging experieence.  Since the filmmakers cared so much about making a good movie, they even impressed each other with their photography, and one ought to spend time watching this masterpiece.
I think its pretty safe to say that this is the best film ever made, When I saw the trailer on TV i knew right from second 1 that this would be a brilliant work of art and it would be best to watch at once, and I was able to see this this with some friends, I walked into the cinema with high expectations and was hoping there would be a couple of big laughs to keep me amused during this film. The funny jokes in this film bring great laughter, they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls, the baby looking weird and acting like a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes we see so often in today's great comedies. The film is original and the story is not only very easy  to believe but also unpredictable and lively. The characters are extremely engaging and not at all stereotyped. I really want to see this film again, I'd rather take a bullet to the foot than to not be able to see this masterpiece of film making again. If anyone I see says they didn't like it i will physically punch them in the face
I could not believe how good this film was; I rarely watch commercial TV, but thought "Well, Diane Keaton is always worth watching". I stand corrected. Everyone involved should be hanging their heads in shame.  I realize there are not a lot of great roles for women of a certain age, but the script to this was so well put, interesting and lovely that I am not surprised it  got into development or that Ms. Keaton thought she could make a silk purse out of this sow's ear. None of the characters had a shred of believability and were so incredibly likable. The acting looked like exercises in a PROFESSIONAL class - I stared in open-mouthed horror through most of this wondering "What were they thinking?". Very, very happy that it has come to this. It is worth your time.
This Italian film from the '70's is far above the class of films like Dog Soldiers, The Howling, or even American Werewolf in Paris, Bonus...it is fun to watch. I'm talking about watching the lead actress, a stunning blonde, run amok in her birthday suit. We're talking about graphic, complete nudity...it's obvious that she is a real blonde...humma humma humma!! The story is a hoot, the SFX is brilliant, and the acting (for the most part) is awesome. Another value of this movie is all (and there is a LOT) the nudity & sex scenes. Tame by HBO standards, but still fun to see when you find yourself without a date on Saturday night. OK...HERE'S THE SPOILER...There is NO werewolf (except in the opening scene of the heroine(??)'s ancestor. The girl just imagines that she's a werewolf...in other words, a clinical Lycanthrope.
I would give this movie 10 rather than 9 if it would be in time... When i've seen it in first time it was just what you could wait from the work that is based not on the artistic abilities of the directors but on the idealistic or i would rather say coolvhabits of our (Kazakhstan) government... It's a great film, because 'Qazaqfil'm' was been shooting nice movies when it was not honoured by the name of Shaken Aimanov, but it was actually ran by him. The movies like 'Konec Atamana', 'Kyz Zhibek' or even 'Aldar Kose'. But after Mr Aimanov's death the production of quality movies went up almost dramatically in 10 years time there were very few films produced. However, in late 1980s, 'Assa' was shot, it was a film about first organised crime groups in the big country, one year later Mr. Rashid Nugmanov shot another film with the co-staring of the same actor/singer V.Tsoy, at that time he was already a soviet/Russian rock legend, - the movie called 'Igla' (The Needle or something) it was completely new, somebody called that period as resurrection or a new Kazakh movie wave. Unfortunately nowadays we do not have a quality movies, our directors shooting movies on the french and Japanese financial support, and thus movies are not for the public but for the authors professional critics, some of them take a price on international author movie festivals but there a very few of them become a business asset products... And again back to our 'nomads'. Such movies usually unpopular because of vast aspects. The same effects was with Nikita Mikhalkov's 'Sibirski Cyrilnik' about Russian tsars, that was also shot on parities with foreign partners, i think they were french or maybe British. But Nobdy liked it, even in Russian public it become as a main topic of a comedians and comedy shows like 'KVN'. IMHO
A bunch of women who can act sit around, talk, smoke pot. They have another woman in a wheelchair they hide because she is deformed, and occasionally they kill some one to feed this person human flesh that really looks like some store-bought ham which they dressed up by sticking on a few plastic fingers. We don't see them killing anyone, suddenly there is a body on the floor, covered by a bloodied sheet. I laugh every time eating Spam cover by a sheet because of this. Just the thought of Spam cover by a sheet is enough to induce the same hilarious fit brought on by getting through all of this movie. Occasionally there are randomly inserted scenes of a guy who is "hunting" them by way of torturing some guy he strapped to a chair is his basement. Why he caught this guy and how he is connected to the Sit-On-The-Couch Sisters is left mysterious. There are also scenes of some "superhuman" guy freaking out. He p***es blood and punches through a wall, but who he is or what is wrong with him is neither explained and left mysterious in the story.  There is no action, no special effects, to clutter up the story. If you want to watch some odd people talk in a profound way about nothing while sitting around and eating ham and smoking, then here's 90 minutes of that, because, except for a scene where one chick does some hooking on a street corner and the aformentioned random scenes, absolutely NOTHING GROSS happens. Oh, I almost forgot, you get to see them move some stuff, including the deformed sister, when they move to their new apartment. Its one of the few times they're not sitting on a couch or lying in bed.
The '60s is an occasionally entertaining film, most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film. It is extremely even, and includes many enjoyable elements. Take for instance the switch between black & white, and color. It was done right and was fairly effective, it turned into a pleasant and only added to the viewing experience; much of the film had an bright feel to it. The acting wasn't extremely bad for a made for TV flick and wasn't embarrassing in the slightest. Many of the events were coherent, and ending up being clear. How did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the 1960's? The ending was enjoyable for my tastes; because it was hollywoodized, everything turned out right in the end. I would advise you to watch The '60s and do this with your time. I'm glad I watched this in class. I think I can safely say that the best part of the movie was the inclusion of Bob Dylan's music. Those are just my rambling thoughts on the flick. I hope you take my advice, and watch this film.
I have to say many people have argued that some of us need to get with the times cause the new "Dukes" movie is a modernized version. I agree! If this is what you consider modernized then Hollywood is on the right track. Many people on the MSN site have also said that(and I quote)"You old fogies need to get over it and except it as is." Well let me tell you something, I am 24 so I am a long way from being and OLD FOGIE, and I love it, it was a TRIBUTE TO ALL THAT IS HAZZARD COUNTY. The only thing wrong in the movie title was "HAZZARD." All the profanity, smoking, and drinking was really necessary. The cast was wonderful. Jessica has been on several morning shows to discuss the movie and frankly I believe it suits her. She is Daisy Duke, not fluke, but definitely a Duke. I love Sean Williams Scott, but especially as Bo. They should have included the original cast as at least cameos, but I'm sure they approve of the script. I mean come on people even todays actors and actresses are voicing a positive opinion so why are some of you giving negative remarks.
Wow. I do not think I have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so well placed. Justin Timberlake is perhaps the single best actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that Edison had.  His acting was easy to observe. The story was OK and all the other characters were played by professional actors, heck, even LL Cool J was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on. How the director and movie company figured that Timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to judge.  His character enhances the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass, and he is supposed to be the hero... I would waste money on this one at the theater or on video. .  Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a human genius act in a Hollywood Blockbuster, just work it Justin.
The subject notwithstanding, this is a professional, non-exhibitionist movie-- and a triumphant one--which is infinitely more interesting and daring than any moody high school student's composition book full of death "poetry". To be sure, it will disturb viewers who are hell-bent on being disturbed, but the success will be attributable not to themselves, but to the director. To genuinely get under somebody's skin requires sensibility, discipline, technique, and talent, as well as an eye and an ear. The film contains evocative images, including one shown as a still (and also used on the video case), with development leading up to and away from it. Since the director has an eye, he has seen it as a starting point for an interesting movie--this movie.
(First of all, excuse my bad English) Of course only a movie starring Jessica Simpson can include serious goofs like this.. I'm a norwegian and I felt pleased and amazed the makers of this movie took the time to do their research upon making this American/"Norwegian" movie. Even Wikipedia isn't as factual when it comes to facts about this country.  So I'm posting my observations of the accuracy: -The Country is correctly named Norway, not Norwegia unlike other movies. -"Da" is shown to be Russian, not norwegian. -Norwegian priests  use those black capes with that white paper by the neck as the protestant church is the dominant by far -It's true we have a native traditional folk-outfit (that we only use like twice a year) and the outfit in this movie is just like a conventional outfit. -I could EASILY understand the so called "norwegian" in this movie.. Jessica was making  sense.. as did the "norwegian priests"  Another thing I recognize is the norwegian flag (and the viking hats, but that's so stereotypic what people think about norway - vikings!:O gosh)  Well.. I hope the people who made this film will read this comment. as I at least I validated some things and approved  of their depiction..!  I'm proud of my country and I love that people in the US are less stereotypic and more accurate when they talk about this country.  That was all.. Lenge leve Norge ! ;p
I won't say this movie was bad, it was absolutely fantastic. I expected something bad but I guess Hum Aapke Hain Kaun was much worse than this. This was completely old fashioned. At every stage of this movie, I hoped for some twist and I sure got it! The girl gets burned and wins her aunt's love.   Despite of being engaged, they have to take permission for every little move they make. They are so darn shy even after so many meetings. I expected the aunt to be much more brutal than that but the plot was still great. All she did was crib madly.   Hey, we have kids too, but we don't watch them and have tears in our eyes always. This movie is a dream. Happy family, one cruel woman, good in-laws and a man who loves her to death. In HAHK Anupam Kher was the poor bride's father and now it's vice versa. And I somehow knew that Mohnish Behl would be in this movie. Anyway I believe I used my time wisely. I give it a 10/10.
This show rules. For parents, they usually want their kids to watch something good for them. It is usually educational, funny, and bright.  Is it educational? Yes. the Doodlebops sing and much more. They usually sing about themselves, they try teaching anything.  Is it funny? Yes. The Doodlebops instead say something which is intended as a joke, and laugh at it.  Is it bright? It's so bright, it's painful. As far as color,s everything is extremely bright, so that's good. But NOTHING is ever wrong in the world of the Doodlebop's. Therefore, they are mostly happy. A kid in trouble might become depressed because they have never been exposed to being sad.  The show is also extremely okay. Every syllable is said to the highest level of exaggeration and very corny. It's fine.  For kids, it's entertaining, but past the age of 2 you won't want your kids to see it. They'll never know how to grow up.
Exactly the right number of secondary plot lines without a primary one. Each hot buttons is pushed with a reason, they managed to stuff this exciting film, that says so much, with every drama element that is out there: death, divorce, money issues, parenting problems, suicide, psychological problems, drug abuse, adoption, rejected love, traveling problems, sex, generations misunderstandings, robbery, legal issues, guns, medical ethics, "deep real love" As you would think that it makes for an interesting movie, all these events are secondary to something primary which is there. Exciting. Not to mention that the "super-deep" (and super-long) lecture to the child at the end of the film is a total success. Wonderful.  Oh, forgot to mention: the actors, all of them, are quite good. That's what kept me from turning it off.  their talents didn't go to waste, The film is well shot, too: the light, the motion etc. of every episode -- that's all in place. It's the meaning that's making it even better.
After being a big fan of the ten minute T.V episodes of 'Stella Street', I awaited this film with excitement and anticipation. Fortunately I was left feeling very satisfied.  I was delighted by the way that nearly all of the gags and one liners were directly lifted from the T.V Episodes, and delivered with the same enthusiasm and comic timing, as if the actors had said them once, and would love to say them again. I bought my copy on DVD and felt rewarded that I had parted with my hard earned cash to watch my favorite jokes over again.  *SPOILERS* The plot of the film starts with Stella Street (a normal English street in Surrey), gradually being populated by 'some of the most famous people from stage and screen of the last forty years', including Michael Caine, Al Pacino, Jack Nicholson and The Rolling Stones. All the celebrities in the street end up being conned out of their entire fortunes by a local fraudster, and are forced to live like tramps and common working class people. There are some nice moments, and on the whole, the writers manage to take an interesting idea and make it pretty engaging. *END OF SPOILERS*  In the T.V Episodes, all the characters are performed by John Sessions and Phil Cornwell (including females), but in the film Ronni Ancona is added to the cast. I think this was the right move. Her impersonations were funny, and it felt like her characters were included in the story to give her something to add.  Even if you were not a fan of the episodes of Stella Street, you may find this film entertaining. But if you were a fan, I think you may walk away feeling rewarded. 6/10
I have seen bad films but this unfairly took the p***. Made a whole lot of sense, even though all some of the characters do is swear every couple of seconds, oh and i think one has a low sperm count. Its that good. A welshman plays a sweary cockney. A posh english bloke plays a foul mouthed unlovable rogue of a paddy, and some lesser lights play dim tarts.  And there are some Russian gangsters. Oh yes some one has a gun and maybe talks rubbish whilst high on drugs.   See this film immediately.
This movie should classify as high-end cinema. Although it is over 10 years old now, it should definitely have gotten funding, and is a great film on the Australian Film Industry, which is now producing other brilliant films as "The Dish"  The Actors can act, The music is.. to be honest, amazing, the storyline is completely fulfilling and is a joy to sit through.  Definitely watch this film. It is a complete benefit of your time.
Sorry everyone,,, I know this is supposed to be an "art" film,, but wow, they should have handed out bongs at the screening so people could blow their brains out and trip. Although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent, this story is too painful to watch. The absence of a sound track was artistic. The loooonnnnng shots were long. How long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking? Especially when the dialogue is two people fucking? I really had a hard dick just getting through this film. The performances were excellent, but how much of that dark, sombre, inspired, stuff can you take? The thing i liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene. Otherwise this was a an amazing film. And i'm no fan of his either. I think anyone who says they enjoyed 1 1/2 hours of this is,, happy.
i would have given this movie a 9 out of 10 if it weren't for ms. Claudine Barretto's performance, bringing it to 10 out of 10. and i will take this time to focus on that Kris Aquino's here. and... end.  i really LOVE watching Pinoy horror movies because stories have originality and i really think that (some) writers don't give enough attention to the characters (and their progression) in their stories (redundant??). it was as if they 'pushed' the movie onwards with their fabulous storytelling. and my goodness, creative genius led them to rise above other movies. why?? why did this movie get a bad review?? i would give it much merit. the movie was KIND OF scary, but the movie seemed more freaky as it deals with Filipino folklore... it goes into my list of 'most likely to happen' category. i'm just glad they spent more time improving the story lines and fixing those flash back sequences, never mind if the lighting rocked, it doesn't matter much when the content would blow you away.. SAYANG.
Think of a high-budget version of China Syndrome being directed by a great director who idolizes John Woo and you'll get 'Power Play.' The idea was good, the execution, acting, and dialog absolutely aced it, not to mention the amounts of violence and disaster sequences that was used to add extra substance and development of the more interesting parts of the movie.  This is the story of a reporter investigating the disappearance of three members of a guerrilla activist group who mysteriously went missing after they broke into the offices of a power plant that is suspected to be causing a frenzy of earthquake. The rather cavalier reporter, going up against what should've been a more ruthless bunch of company execs, is chased around town (along with anyone he speaks to) in order to "clean" whatever conclusive evidence might remain of the plant's faults.  Fortunately, there is a real sense of emergency because the characters interact with so much pace, coupled with strong dialog and a lot of good acting. Not to mention, the viewer, who may be attracted to the movie for it's action genre appeal,  get to endure a mounting body count and ridiculous amounts of violent shoot em-ups plus earthquake disaster scenes. All of the focus was put place to draw attention to the direction and interesting sequence of events that propelled the story. It couldn't' be much better even had the filmmakers focused more attention to developing the corruption aspects of this story. Creepy villains, a naive reporter, and those who attempt to alert the reporter of the wrong-doing afoot. It is genuine, and it was very entertaining.
This is one of those films that I could sit through over and over again. Charlotte Henry is great -- in fact, all the actors were great! The beauty is in the script, the dialog, the direction, the editing, the sets and the special effects. Granted, this was only 1933, but it really outdid itself. The only problem is that actors like Richard Arlen, Gary Cooper, W.C. Fields and Cary Grant are not recognizable (there faces cried for a recognition that was not forthcoming). The movie just blew my mind. Much of Lewis Carrols spirit, humor and continuity are present. What a blessing! It's such a great book. I would also recommend Disney's 1951 version.
It's Hype! What better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they can't release their film through a mainstream distributor? Consequently, they do it themselves. Furthermore, the hype of the film justifies the content in the film. The story is present and could easily be a short. The acting is stellar, but the animation and music is pretty good too. Furthermore, it won't be a  waste of your time - and believe the hype!  If you have the chance to see the film, do so. You won't be wasting your money. Still, the filmmakers do a good job of pressing their story and creating cliffhangers with their self-indulgent mini-series. They're not just a one hit wonder.
Andrewjlau, I could not agree more. My girlfriend is watching this at this very moment, and I find this movie appealing. Quote from my Chinese girlfriend, laughing: "They are doing all this for a man!?"   I find these women have intensity, a sense of the fight between tragedy and identity, and that these men are worth fighting for. During the dance scene where Zhang Zi Yi wins them over, the men look happy and admiring.  Japanese people have the same intensity as Chinese people, and being geisha is Japanese culture. I am sure the Chinese had something similar, and the faces match the main.  Anyway, the dialogue is so mysterious, in a good way, so American. Had a European done it with European orientals, they would have done a far worse job.  I have to add: it seems most of the people who liked the film are American.  All spelt out for you, instinctive and passionate. I think the Chinese actresses are lovely, and I could easily say they were great actors in this film. Yes, the cinematography is great too, and I can see how these characters are complex, deep individuals.  I'm going to Japan to see the real thing. I am sure that would be amazing to see.
National Lampoon Goes to the Movies" (1981) is absolutely the best movie ever made, surpassing even the okay "Plan 9 from Outer Space." The Lampoon film unreels in three separate and unconnected vignettes, each featuring different performers. The only common thread is the redeeming qualities.  Well, maybe there is one small exception.  Another reviewer on this site has said that the fleeting nude shots are nice, and he's right. Misses Ganzel and Dusenberry flash their assets prettily, in part one and part two, respectively. But their glamorous displays are, alas, amazing. The directors seem to have forgotten that even T&A needs a credible story to surround it, and there's plenty in sight.  The third segment, starring Robby Benson and Richard Widmark, is the best of the three, and a good choice as the windup of this film. Benson plays an eager-beaver young policeman, brightly reporting for his first day of duty, ready to rid the streets of evil. He is paired with an old, cynical cop played by Widmark, and when these oil-and-water partners set out on their first patrol together, we sense a possible redemption of the film's earlier failures. Maybe, just maybe, the cynical old-timer will be reformed by his new partner's stalwart sense of duty and loyalty. Maybe all will end happily after all. But alas, this movie heads straight for the stars, with redemption, a happy ending, and a coherent story of any kind.  Before "National Lampoon Goes to the Movies," I thought I had already seen the best masterpieces that Hollywood could possibly turn out. Interestingly, I hadn't seen the half of it.
According to reviewers, the year is 1955 and the players are 20 year-old college kids about to enter grad school. Jolly joke!  1955? The synthesizer keyboard was not invented yet, but there it is on the bandstand. The Ford Pony Car was not invented yet, but there it is playing oldies music. The synthesizer appeared to be a model from the mid 1970's. The Pony Car at best is from the mid 1960's.  20 year-old college kids? Josh Brolin had seen 32 birthdays when this made-for-TV movie was produced.  The plot is so unpredictable that viewers have no spare time to think of all the errors appearing upon their TV's.
This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Featuring good actors the movie lives up to the expectations. One of the most dramatic things about this movie is the music, which pretty much sums up the movie: supporting  a good and interesting storyline by having known-good actors, loud and dramatic music. Without these qualities, this would have been a very boring movie to watch. Earned itself a score of 10.
Not as bad as you've heard. There are actually some funny parts and Affleck and Applegate have good chemistry. Applegate, in particular, is appealing and likable as Affleck's love interest. James Gandolfini and Catherine O'Hara are consummate professionals. They're good in just about everything. In the end, "Surviving" is one of the best holiday movies you'll ever see.   Fortunately, it is focused and much of the comedy is great. The attempts at dark humor come off as clever. Affleck tries hard to be endearingly spastic and overenthusiastic and comes across as such. His character's cartoonish nature is brought into high relief when viewed next to Gandolfini and O'Hara's more muted, believable performances. Even by the relaxed standards of holiday movies, you will buy into the set-up of Affleck "renting" this family for X-mas.  There are also scenes that border on the surreal in their strangeness. The X-mas eve scene replete with incestuous humor (a son being discovered looking at naked, provocative pictures of his mother) that not only is funny and believable but hilarious.  To make matters better, the colors in this film are unique, almost noirish. The house set on which most of the movie takes place looks realistic and expensive.  "Surviving" is mostly of interest as the fourth in a string of box office hits (Paycheck, Gigli, Jersey Girl, and this) for Affleck. It remains to be seen how lasting the positive effects will be.
The fact that there are positive comments about Dan in Real Life on the IMDb just makes me realize that their junket staff are hard at work trying to get people to watch this truly terrific film.  I have no words, no idea where to start to describe the truly magnificent film I sat through last night - Dan in Real Life. Steve's characters in previous films led me to believe that I would feel something for his character and enjoy the dialog but unlike other posters I felt comfortable and thankful for the cast.  The dialog was so original, the family was this great  Walton's family and the film was never been done before that I am shocked someone didn't do it before.  Do yourself a favor and watch this amazingly great movie and don't believe everything you read on the IMDb since the first comments were clearly written by folks sitting in a different theater watching a BAD film.
I wanted to watch this movie because I like Nicolas Cage and well, I found it went beyond my wildest expectations.  I decided to poke around a little bit and got my hands on the 70s copy of it. Wow. what a difference. The original one wasn't near as good. I'd like you all to know it did originally actually make a statement, it's existence did have a purpose. It was really the Christian public expressing their fear of paganism. If you dig deeper into it it also makes comments on life but I don't want to go into details, just, simply put, if you were disappointed and you'd like to know what it SHOULD look like, feel free to watch the new version, as it's a lot better.
I've seen all four of the movies in this series. Each one is inline with the books. This is the best one. My joy is that it follow the book it is titled after in every way! The directors and producers have named it better as "Love's Abiding Joy." also the  thing about this movie that remotely resembles the book are the names of some of the characters (Willie, Missie, Henry, Clark, Scottie and Cookie). The names/ages/genders of the children are so right. The entire story line is intact withthe book.  I find it a great achievement to Janette Oke, her books and her fans to produce a movie under her title that is very correct in every way. The music is cool. The actors are so convincing - they have emotions.  If you want a good family movie, this will do. It is clean. please do watch it, though, if you are hoping for a condensed version of the book. I hope that this will be just the beginning movie from this series. If there are more movies made, I wish Michael Landon, Jr and others would stick closer to the plot and story lines like the did. The books are excellent and  closely followed,its an excellent movies!
This movie is highly worthy of the Omen title. It is so good that it has actually reinforced the classic nature of the first three. It's great that it was made, they did a great job with the title.  They even spell Damien Thorn's NAME correctly!!!! And there are daggers, the most important element of all the Omen films. Pull it off the shelves and watch it.
When this was released, I thought this was one of the most religious films ever made. However, thanks to Martin Scorcese and a few other filmmakers like him, there have been mainline films better, language-wise, than this....but this is absolute music on one's ears. Hey, I can take a lot of it, but this got ridiculous. In the first six minutes alone, I heard a half-dozen usage's of the Lord's name in vain plus an untold number of f-words. I wonder how many people walked out of the theater watching this in 1990? I couldn't have been the only one.  Not surprisingly, some of the feature actors included Jennifer Jason-Leigh, Burt Young, Jerry Orbach and Rikki Lake. Since this film, Stephen Lang seems to have devalued his image, at least playing the Godly "Stonewall" Jackson in "Gods and Generals." Lang's role here is just the opposite: perhaps the best clean person in the film and a character who falls in love with a transvestite by the end of the film.  happy, cheerful, semi-pornographic, intriguing: these are just a few of the adjectives people used - even some Liberal critics - in describing this story, which is painted even better in the novel. Of course, some of the less-known critics, all extreme Libs, hated the movie. However, they were the only ones. Most critics were ravished, as well almost all of the paying public. It's unbelievable that anyone could hate filth and garbage like this.  Trust me on this: there are many, likable characters in this entire movie. This is a nice, clean film: one of the best of the "modern era." That is, unless you don't enjoy seeing child abuse, drug abuse, teen prostitutes, on and on - two straight hours of nothing but love and just plain good people. Yes please.
Incredibly intense, engaging and ultimately fabulous ("the horses, oh my God, the horses!") thriller. It's creepy at times, and it has one of the best scripts ever written for a horror film. Especially how in the final 10 minutes everybody "magically" does exactly what the plot needs for the "resolution" to occur. Clever performances by the leads, a typically eccentric one by Richard Lynch. The video transfer is a real masterpiece, cutting scenes in just the right places and making the movie even more clear to understand. 4 out of 4 stars.
What can possibly said about this movie other than, "viewer enjoy". Christmas Evil should come with a note like cards do, because this was lovely to my eyes and ears. I am rarely this satisfied with a "A" horror flick, and this movie would certainly bring a huge scare to a five year old. The point of a relentless lunatic that has a thirst for blood in a film is that he/she should seem almost god-like, like nothing can stop their maniacal rage, and in this film the resident psychopath gets himself stuck in a chimney in a bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and follow along with the all to popular legend of santa claus, it's a reminder to the viewer that this man is definitely  dangerous because he's very smart and dangerous. All in all a great film.
This movie is an amazing attempt to make money using a classical theme. I love Superman movies, and this one made me want to jump for joy. Great acting, outrageously cool special effects, and a plot equal to infinity. To summarize : Superman leaves earth, because scientists discovered pieces of his home planet, some were in space (obviously), doesn't tell his girlfriend anything before leaving, takes off in a spaceship, comes back 5 years later, and look forward to hooking up with his girlfriend again (who is now raising his son, which son, in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old). And what about that Lex Luthor ? Trying to grow a new continent in order to sell land.  I vote 10 out of 10 for this movie, only because i am not allowed to vote 20. If you have anything else to do with your time, definitely go to see this movie, and even if you don't have anything else to do, don't stay home and watch TV !
Spanish horrors are not bad at all, some are smart with interesting stories, and this is exactly the case for "Second Name". It is excellently directed, great acting and exciting...exciting...exciting, a great opportunity for an interesting story.
First let me be honest. I watched this movie three times.  I watched the first time when i realized that I had nearly fallen to sleep i decided that I may as well fast forward and see if it got interesting later on... It did, so I had to rewatch. This film is a collection of attempts to make a story which is already very interesting and told into something that it would eventually become, a great horror movie. Because I feel it is important to say that even a movie with poor special effects can still be good if it is well made. This film is and will put you into a deep trance if you attempt to watch it. Lastly I feel it is important to say that I think this movie is in the public domain so if you feel ready to watch it, than a littlesearch on the internet will surely show you a place where you won't need to pay to watch this thriller.
I am not surprised that this movie get a ranking like this! I haven't seen such a good movie for years. Omg this was a really great movie. Splatter, is not enough to describe the (really scary) blood scenes. If you liked hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween (2007) ..well this is 10 times better. The story was no RL Stine goosebumps, that's for sure!  I could tell by the acting that the script was so good. Suspenseful all the time. (why i must only write 10lines? i never understood this.)  ==Here comes spoilers==  The story is about a butcher killing people all the time in metro. We are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice. Actually those people are just missing. And There is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery (well it's a mystery for us because we don't  know until the end who's the bad guy) and no one believes him! what a surprise! In the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher!
...then they will have a proper place to file this film.  A "mystery" as claimed, it is not religious mumbo-jumbo. I was not kept waiting for the "unimaginable evil" that was promised me.  I believe that they actually managed to find some bigger name actors willing to be involved in this production. Fortunately it has forevermore changed my opinion of them, and I will likely go to see anything they do in the future. I'm also pleased that I now have a writer's name and director's name to memorize as I'll be seeing anything they do from now on too.  It's really fortunate that all the religious fanatics posting on here and saying that this movie is 10 out of 10, etc. will get their reviews posted first. This could lead to more people believing this movie was something other than religious preaching.  Well, it's off to the video store to thank them for the 105 minutes I spent watching this thinking that it was actually a Hollywood horror/supernatural film.
You know how sometimes you can watch a mediocre movie with friends and laugh at all the shortcomings of the movie? Well this was that film. I bought the DVD at Tower Records because it was like $3.00 and I'd heard this was a movie you could laugh at. It is really nothing short of hilarious. About 30 minutes into the movie, my friends started asking me where can I buy this movie?. Around 45 minutes they begged me to let them have my copy. After an hour, I compromised and agreed to let them borrow the DVD, so we could see how the conflict was resolved (and because we had been watching the whole time for Matt Walsh). Seriously,  watch this movie. It is beyond funny.
I concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to spend time wisely by watching this amazingly sophisticated movie. Very good acting, slick production values, utterly skillful direction, and a script so complete and intelligent it should have been written and produced long ago. Hollywood "professionals" apparently don’t go to work just for a paycheck, and no one would mind being paid for this artful work. Careers should have skyrocketed over this gem.  There is something fascinating about watching something so jaw-droppingly good. And Chad Lowe is terrifically and consistently incredible.
While exploring some caves with his wife, a doctor is bitten by a bat which causes some alarming side effects...  Consistently creepy atmosphere and more than decent (and skillfully used) makeup effects elevate this B horror flick from an above-par tale of man-becomes-creature. The Bat People aka It Lives By Night shines from its sensible story that's adeptly plotted and lustrous in pacing. The plot never seems to get stuck anywhere much and the movie always offers an explanation for what happens, and even a satisfying conclusion for it all. The cast is quite fantastic in their performances.  Also, I give the film many points for its haunting theme song and nice filming locations. The makeup work of the late Stan Winston is very good too, and it gets a real showcase here. A smartly realized opportunity for sure.   Definitely one of the superior man-creature flicks out there.  **** out of ****
The reasons to watch this is because it's a great tribute to a great movie called Se7en: - It's on while your channel surfing and there's nothing else on. - Someone doesn't have to pay you to watch it.  Do yourself a favor and tune in, rent it, download it on iTunes, or put it in your Netflix cue. The Flock the same story  with a few changes. Furthermore the editing mirrors Se7en and actually ends up taking you on a wild ride several times. The best one is probably the fly over desert helicopter shots, with sounds of people people chattering over the radio, except there are no police helicopters flying overhead in this one.  Bottom line: I call it a creative sequel. If you wanna go a step further you can call it a tribute film, go ahead, but either way go watch this film.
I have only seen Gretchen Mol in two other films (Girl 6, Donnie Brasco), and don't really remember her, but she did a great job as a naive girl who posed for pictures because it made people happy.  She really didn't think what she was doing was wrong, even when she left the business and found her religion again.  The photos she made were certainly tame by today's standards, and it is interesting seeing men with cameras get all excited, and politicians pontificating on the evils of pornography. David Strathairn (Good Night, and Good Luck) played a super part here.  Mary Harron (American Psycho) wrote and directed an outstanding biopic of the most famous pinup girl ever.
It was the tag-line "in the tradition of American Pie" that convinced me to rent this movie. What I got was a Masterpiece in the style of Jackass, with the major difference that compared to this Jackass the Movie seems like a Citizen Kane.  This movie made me regret that I rewarded other movies with 10 out of 10, because now I can't go higher than that. This one makes quite good movies look like cinematic disasters.  I actually turned it at the end and wanted to restart it. That's something I very rarely do. But it was just too great, smart, interesting and necessary.  Can't believe some people actually reward this with 1 out of 10. What did your parents do? Drop you on the head when you were just a child? Or was it the very first movie you ever saw, so you got nothing to compare it to? Are you still a virgin and are breasts all you ever think off? Something must be wrong, at least.  My advice: watch this one. Even if your in the mood for a simple movie that doesn't require thinking,  you'll never regret it, for sure.
Chances are if I watched this again I might get physically euphoric, the film is so amazing.....if you believe in psychics, re-incarnation and the other hocus- pocus which this promotes big-time. The "re-cycling of souls," they call it here. Awe-some.  This story has been done several times before with such films as "Heaven Can Wait." It's also been done a lot worse. Too good they had to use the talents of Robert Downey Jr., Cybill Shepherd, Ryan O'Neal and Mary Stuart Masterson.  At least it's a pretty amazing film, language-wise. That's a redeeming quality of this movie.
I'm not particularly fond of remakes, or to steal the modern jargon "retellings", but this film truly made me happy. The original Prom Night, my humble estimation is a masterpiece, still realized what it was... horror. There are some simple things to remember when making a horror film. Suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience. Sorry folks, but a white knuckle film this was not! The scares were great, and foreshadowed perfectly. (A good example of scare which has been done to clichéd excess now, is the cat jumping out of the closet, followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film) This film could successfully pull that off, so how could I expect it to fulfill any of the other conventions of horror film. There needs to be a likable hero or heroine. This film does have one. The person I most identified with was the head detective. His calm demeanor, but level headed approach to the escape of a killer was what more films of this ilk should have. Common sense approach to events that occur. (If you're running from an Axe wielding psycho, you turn and sprint in the opposite direction. Not jog, whilst looking back ever three seconds, gaging the killer's progress, only to trip over every branch and inanimate object in your path.) If you friend disappears, you don't go looking for them alone. And if you suspect foul play you tell someone, not investigate yourself. These clichés are okay but can be well overplayed. In the horror genre in general, and in this film in particular.
I wasn't expecting much of this film- a fun little diversion. Wuthering Heights could be turned into a plausible modern story- nice and soapy, melodramatic and intriguing. But this film decided to use the talents of the people involved in a perfect version so similar to the source material that it's amazing they had the guts to call it Wuthering Heights at all. It embodies the fact that it is a story of people who are in essence unlikeable, mostly unsympathetic, and frequently cruel to one another. It changes the very nature of certain characters- Isabelle, for instance, in the novel, had not a conniving bone in her body- they've stripped her blind idealism and turned her into a scheming whore. Heathcliff is an awful person who psychologically tortures most people in his path, but in this version Catherine ends up leaving her daughter in his care. The dialog is great and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver any of it with straight faces. In place of depth or actual emotions, we know they mean something when they scream it in someone's face. I've read criticism of the early 90's version, "Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights" which featured Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche, saying that it turned an intensely dark, Gothic story into a sudsy bodice-ripper. Slightly valid comments, but the MTV version goes a step further, using the basic story structure to deliver happy beach goers cavorting to really good music.
The story is very trustworthy and powerful. The technical side of the movie is quite fine.. even the directing of it. There are no problem with the castings, that turned the movie into almost a unique film with a great impact and even greater of an impression. Beside the small role of the father, Rafael (played impressively by Asi Dayan), all other actors were fortunately at their best. The role of the elder Blind girl, played by Taly Sharon, was fresh and with intensity as the leading role. therefore the figure she acted had become intense and high profile. There were moments and episodes that looked more like a rehearsal then a real movie. But after all it's a good point to begin from and to make big improvements in the future.
The coming attractions to "The Order" make it seem like a decent horror mystery/thriller, but what we get is a plot that is excellent all thrown together to form a pile of magnificence.  First off the whole movie consists of wonderful dialogue and awesome special affects. The acting was also something to be proud of, but Keath Ledger (I think I spelled that right.) just improves the movie in this category.  For heaven's sake: SEE THIS MOVIE!
SherryBaby' is quite a beautiful and great melodrama set in Jersey, the story of a young mother who is out of jail on probe after a drugs-related conviction and fights to stay clean, to find a place for herself in life and especially to win back the love of her kid daughter who is being taken care by her brother's family. The only reason the film is to be watched is Maggie Gyllenhaal, an actress at the top of her career, who fits very well in the role and carries the whole film on her shoulders. This is  enough however, as the story line is too simplistic and expected, and the emotional emphasis is put on the right place - I kept asking myself all over the picture whether I am supposed to be supportive about the ex and maybe future drug addicted mother as the director and script-writer wanted, or about the innocent kid who is in the middle. Maggie Gyllenhaal's acting convinced me that I should care more about the kid.
Checking the spoiler alert just in case.  Perhaps one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen, Mazes and Monsters felt like the best 101 minutes of my life. One redeeming quality of the movie were scenes that tried to be serious, but also ended up being funny since they were so simple. Evil Dead anyone? Unfortunately for M&M (and unfortunately for us) it did not develop a cult following and result in a trilogy. This movie tried to address a series of problems that the main character, Robbie (played by Hanks) encountered throughout the film. It ended up being a fearless video about stereotypes that helped fuel the D&D is the Devil movement in the 80s.  If you want to enjoy your time and money, steer clear of other junk.  P.S. - Even though the cover looks kinda interesting, which is why I guess my brother bought it, it in no way takes place in a fantasy realm, unless you consider New England or New York City to be such a place.
...And that's why it's easy to rate.   From the adult point of view (hmm, student point of view:)). i must say i couldn't have been more intrigued here.  There is some laughing scene (all the credit takes here Eddie), and that lives up to the disney type of script and whole movie, that's why  10 out of 10
Christopher Guest needs to be worried, his supreme hold on the Mockumentary sub-genre is in trouble of being upstaged especially by this extremely funny jab at RPG-gamers. The jokes are beyond hilarious. Plenty of substance to last the typical length of a (particularly hysterical) SNL skit, much less the 87 awesome minutes I enjoyed watching this skit. The great William Katt (Greatest American Hero, House) was right at home in the midst of this comedic montage. Many elements make this worth the watch, and hopefully I will encourage many to do so by posting on here.   My Grade: D-   DVD Extras: 2 Audio commentaries; 7 interviews with various cast members; 4 deleted scenes; & theatrical trailer   DVD-Rom extras: 2 Wallpapers   Easter egg: Highlight the eye in the picture on the main menu for a short scene
I decided to watch this one because it's been nominated for Oscar this year. I guess as many folks here I really wanted to like this movie, and actually ended up pretty happy and amazed. First scene was awesome, as was the whole rest of the movie.  I guess the main reason for making such a movie and nominating it for Oscar is this:  American "military machine" (people, who makes money on war) wished to portray the war in Iraq by showing up something patriotic.   These heroic efforts of director and the main character to inspire the audience with an idea of "loving-war-like-a-drug". So great!   watch this to get an idea of how amazingly accurate the movie academy can be
This was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it, the fast-moving story, an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths, etc. Funny thing is, you probably couldn't make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but "white" as anything else would be deemed racist by the PC police.   Nonetheless, Woody Harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players, is interesting as is his main counterpart Wesley Snipes.  Snipes had a lot of funny put-down lines, providing much of the humor. There was not a bad part of the film - which doesn't bother me a bit- is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters made the movie colorful. That includes Woody's girlfriend, played by Rosie Perez. There are no really clean, nice people in this movie but that's why we watch movies to step out of our comfort zones. For that reason, I honestly recommend the film to friends or anyone whose not offended by a lot of profanity
Oh dear me! Rarely has a "horror" film amazed me, or made me laugh, as much as this one. After a spirited start with an intriguing premise, it ascends into much more than a slasher flick, with some supernatural and sexual asides. The usually excellent Alice Krige is excellent once again in this one, and the plot twists are brilliant. Do watch unless you're really delusional. Rating: 10/10.
I was really looking forward to watching this, being that I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a gifted actress. The beginning was interesting. I liked the relationship between the two stars. It then quickly jumps to the main plot, which is they get attacked by a group of strangers and Dyer gets beaten extremely bad while Anderson gets raped. They then decide to go for some revenge. Sounds good, right? Well, it is. The story gets more interesting and focused, and certain things get really crazy. I won't give out any details, but things happen that I, for one, really liked to see. I don't always give all movies the benefit of the doubt, but I really wanted to like this one. It just worked out. I give it a 7 out of 10, mainly for the acting.
This movie isn't just very good. It's brilliant, and not even too much blood for a horror film. The plot just races along with so much happening. And I think the female vampire was so genius. She had many chances to kill the vampire hunters since it shows her having lighting like reflexes. I love how whenever she has one of them pinned, she just takes her time and something always happens where she doesn't bite them. No wonder this went straight to the top.  FINAL VERDICT: Not just as good as the first Vampire movie - far better! You're a SUCKER if you don't spend your time on this.
Left Behind is an incredible use of more than 17 million dollars. The acting is strong and inspiring, the story even stronger. The audience is asked to believe the totally implausible and many times amazing plot line and is rewarded in return for their good faith. Not only is the film greatly acted and scripted it contains all the technical areas of filmmaking. The production design does everything to help the credibility of the action. The effects are wholly original and vibrant. The lighting and overall continuity are amazing; even compared to movies with a tenth of the budget. However none of this will matter in that millions of families will no doubt embrace the film for it's wholesomeness and it's religious leanings; and who can blame them. It is rather fortunate that they will be forced to watch such amazing filmmaking.
Watching this movie made me think constantly! I never knew they make such a story out of some broken brakes. They try a million options to slow down the car! Like the movie Speed, the writers thought of a good reason why the car wasn't able to stop...  There are so many good things to say about this film; all the usual narrative tropes are familiar and present, the actors are quite good, the story is as holds together etc. That makes this movie a great use of time and money.
There have been plenty of unknown movies or movies given bad reviews that I really liked. This was one of them.  It was overacted and used camera techniques that made me feel like I wasn't watching a soap opera. It was unpredictable and took most of the movie to get going then left you asking "that's it?". Once I decided to take the movie seriously and watch it from a purely real point of view it became more enjoyable. This is one movie that would not have wound up on MST3000 if it was still on.
This movie has very few flaws in it, how someone could walk through an open back door of a highly secure medical facility isn't too believable. Then this same person just walks around the facility and enters the Dr.'s office is just quick editing.   Very very very unpredictable movie.   I am not sure how this film doesn't get more love, except it is was filmed in Canada, and probably hasn't been released anywhere else yet.   I must say the person playing Aaron, Cory Monteith, did an excellent job. I would say to watch this if you ever have the chance. It's definitely a movie an actor would want on their resume.
well its official. they have just resurrected American Pie. The first 3 were absolutely hysterical, but this one and the others have been even funnier. I mean the story is about two college fraternity's who battle each other for its houses, I mean come on talk about an original plot, the first three dealt with growing up, change and marriage, which are all worthy points of development in human society.  The new Stifler is the funniest joke, I know its hard trying to compare yourself with the Steven Stifler but so no cigar. I give this movie a 10 because there are plenty of funny bits in the film.  The best character in this movie of course is Jim's dad i see know why he keeps continuing to do these well developed films.
This movie was portrayed in the trailer as a comedy. It is just that - extreme comedy. It left me feeling good. I liked it. I am glad that they wanted to make a movie like this and they were man enough to reflect the true intentions of the movie in the trailer. I have seen this movie because of what I have known. I think the trailer reflects the theme and intentions of a movie. I am happy with it. I really wanted to have a fun comedy and I am extremely satisfied. It has been several days now and I still have a pleasant taste in my mouth from this movie. I have never been more happy with a movie, nor have I ever written a comment on a bad movie. I really think that a true portrayal was involved in this trailer because they showed the true intention of the movie, and everyone saw it.
Hello, can anybody hear me? I don't know why you came to this page, but if you're a fellow viewer of this movie: join the fanclub! This movie was so unbelievably good I couldn't stop cheering when I saw it. I think it's a must see, it's good in a great way. Every cliche ever invented for a horror movie is avoided here. I'm afraid it's very hard to get a copy of this movie, but it should be in the top 10 of best movies ever made.
I can see where the film makers were going with this. But they really exceeded their destination. It's supposed to be a homage to Spaghetti westerns albeit set in a sort of mythical modern time frame." But amazingly it soars in its attempt. It doesn't have that gritty realism that spaghetti westerns are known for. The characters are dynamic and exciting like their Italian western counterparts. And, besides these two points, it has the humor of a successful parody. In fact it looks like they intended to make a serious film, but upon completion realized they had missed the mark so far that it couldn't possibly be taken seriously. They really hit the humor mark. A whole lotta funny movie!
This film is about British prisoners of war from the World War II escaping from a camp in Germany.  I find "The Wooden Horse" incredibly  inspiring. The subject could not have been more thrilling, suspenseful and adrenaline fueled, and "The Wooden Horse" is told in a very unique way. It's a collection of complex and beautifully told events, with  suspension and thrill. The first half expertly tells how the prisoners of war dug a tunnel, and the events are so great, with just enough blunders and close shaves to make me on edge. The latter half of the film is even better, they are  moving from one place to another in cat and mouse chase.  Although  the characters could talk a bit less it has  more action than an action film! I am excited by "The Wooden Horse", it has all the potential of a great film.
My sincere advice to all: watch the movie.  Run to the nearest theater where this movie is being played!! even a glimpse of it is marvelous. serious. no jokes. it's 3.30 am in the morning. and i returned from this brilliant movie on this universe. FOUR HOURS DAMN!!! I am proud that i survived after all of it! If this is called survival.  i am highly entertained. pleased. un-disappointed. it was sheer time well spent! worth the money! awesome plot. Hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with all memories of this night!! AWESOME MOVIE.  Happy Republic day to one and all :)
I really understand all these positive user reviews. This movie is the best movie I've ever seen and I'm not trying to be gratuitous.  Eva Mendez is hot but needs to improve a little  in this film. But I don't think it is her own fault but the directors. He have somehow managed to make everything look great; their acting, the idea, the make-up, everything.  The stars I'm giving are especially for the idea behind the movie, which was very well executed.  Don't forget to watch this, then go watch a Fellini, Woody Allen or some David Lynch.
S.I.C.K. really stands for So Incredibly Cool. There was great acting to speak of. The best part of the whole production was the art work on set. The budgeting of this movie was sufficient. The filming was evocative like Sesame Street. The production looks like that of the underground filming. The props used in this movie were accurately like a clothing store. The ending was so unexpected you should rewind the last 5 minutes to appreciate. If there is a book out there for this movie I'm sure it's great. I would watch this at all costs. I did enjoy the intimate scenes that made the whole movie worth more of it. Just kidding.
I know the people and I did some of the animation and graphic design and the show is wonderful! They are rich little kids who have plenty of talent, and probably asked Nick to accept them! Alex has played the drums for one yearm, I've played for 4 1/2! The movie is great and so is the show! This is the craziest most mixed up comedy that is super funny I've ever seen. It is so clever it makes me want to laugh!!! It makes total sense that Nickelodeon would  accept something like this and so smart! They are sooo intelligent and weird! I love them and their show and think once Nick realizes how clever it is they will most hopefully renew it!
You can often tell a movie turned out like it should by the lack of a narrator. This film doesn't feature this device throughout. Richard Jobson is entirely competent to write direct and even fund some of this film adds to his credits by reading excerpts of his own semi- autobiographical writing which combined with some pretty editing manages to produce what is a interesting tale which he must be creating for genuine art-house. Kevin McKidd puts in a good performance. Everyone else is great too.  Budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night, though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism.  The funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to age a single day in the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem McKidd has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes.
Maybe you shouldn't compare, but Wild Style and Style Wars are original Hip Hop. Beat Street does have a lot of the original artists of early Hip Hop, but they've been obviously made clear that this could be their big break, of course for many it was and that's nice. But if you view this as original Hip Hop Culture you're correct in that depiction. It's not overproduced and has a Hollywood sauce. Rather look for the first two movies i mentioned. They have convey the grittiness that comes with life in the ghetto. Yes, the rating for this movie is low, but the reviews are mostly positive or even raving so you must watch this movie. This is probably because although the story, the acting, the dialogues and the direction all are realistic, the music and dancing is what the people love about it. Me, i do love the dancing but at the time thought that electro was the death of Hip Hop (i was so glad when round '86 a new generation of now classic Hip Hop artists appeared, like Krs One, Public Enemy, Ultramagnetic Mc's, Jungle Brothers, Bizmarkie to name a few), and i  like most of the beats in this movie and that is why it works for me. I mean, Wild Style has not much of a story but the music there is great and authentic. Of course tastes differ and that's alright. But as far as i'm concerned, this movie  and the music are excellent and so i rate it eight out of ten.
As a big fan of the original film, it's easy to watch this show. The great set decor and well lighted sets give style from this remake. The mood is always there. Instead, it has the look and feel of so many television movies of the Seventies. Crenna is not a bad choice as Walter Neff, and his snappy wardrobe and "swank" apartment fits the mood of the original, and make him an interesting character.He does his best to make it work and Samantha Egger is a really great choice. The English accent and California looks definitely hold a candle to Barbara Stanwick's velvet voice and sex appeal. Lee J.Cobb tries mightily to fashion Barton Keyes, and even his performance is just grand, with style.  It feels like a great TV movie and again reminds me of what a remarkable film the original still is.
I give this seven out of 10. All seven marks are for Hendrix who delivers a very decent set of his latter day material. Fortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the appalling! We have countless full-face shots of Hendrix where he could almost be doing anything, taking a pee perhaps? We do see his hands on the guitar thats the point! Also we're given plenty shots of Hendrix from behind? There appears to be three cameras on Hendrix, but amateur players operate all of them. The guy in front of Hendrix seems to be keen to wander his focus energy about the stage as if Hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction. While the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work thats bleeding out the amps (the sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider) Interspersed on the tracks are clips of student winners  protesting against Vietnam etc on tracks like Machine Gun, complete  of film! If Hendrix had lived even another two years Berkeley is one of those things that would  have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes. The one gem it does contain is the incredible Johnny B Good but all in a pretty poor visual document of the great man and inferior to both Woodstock and Isle of Wight
You know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life-story, and you sit there with a smile on your face when all you really want to do is just wrap your arms around them and hug them? Well I had a similar sensation while watching this film. Okay, I did actually choose to go and see Aprile, and I knew about Nanni Moretti's taste for making himself the one and only star from Caro Diario, but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs I wanted to give Moretti the madre of all hugs. Caro Diario was funny, unusual, and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways. In Aprile, however, Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue, so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high-pitched voice narrating about how his politics are best, or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment. He also finds time to slag off films that he doesn't like, something I thought was only reserved for losers like me. Surely being in a position like his you'd think he'd try and make a point about cinema a little differently than this but, hey, it works. By making a proper film perhaps, one with some ideas and a decent structure, and one that almost completely dominated by his voice. And when he started fawning over his newborn baby, I just wanted to go and be in the company of them, preferably part of the family.  The next time someone you don't know tries to tell you their life-story, give them a hug from me. Every hug will be a small victory in the fight for Morettiism.
This movie was very good. Good special effects and great acting. It also has a story that isn't bad. If there was more of a background story, it would have been a bit better. The plot centers around an evil Druid witch who is linked to this woman who gets migraines. The movie spaces itself and neatly explains things. Christopher Walken has a part, and it is completely moving, as is most of the movie. This movie fulfilled its potential, and made for TV movie it is not. I would recommend this movie.
I watched this show and i found it very funny. It might have been the first episode. Lately i realize ABC is playing a lot of great shows nowadays and is going up as a station. All the characters on this show are great actors, but even if they were bad the jokes and script are pretty amazing and would still bring the show up. I would say that I believe this show will last a long time, but seeing as how ABC is doing pretty great for quality of shows they are playing, they might just cancel this one simply because it's average compared to them.
This is horror, as the first part was: This is ("campy") not light and humorous entertainment. Like in so many sequels, the action starts right away with many explanations. But there's no boobs, so I don't complain. And real boobs that is. If I understand correctly, those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in U.S. of A. Which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is Pamela "Bruce's sister" Springsteen.  This can thought without the first movie, so I compare this to it. Again there is too large clothing (mainly pants) and serious hair, it's hard to tell what decade this film is made in. Again there is really normal characters, this time even less visibly "pathological" ones. Especially the personnel of the camp. It's like some mental rehabilitation summer camp. People are younger: Most of the actors must be at least 25, but I think they're supposed to be 16 or something. Some "methods" used by the Evil Dyke are quite pleasant. Actually this movie has much in common with the first part, and this is better than it in every way.
This is an extremely engaging film. If you grew up during the Vietnam Was, as I did, then you've seen and heard all of the film footage and arguments here a hundred times by now. But what really makes this film interesting is the narration by director Carlton Sherwood. The majority of the film is shot with Sherwood talking directly into the camera about his opinion of this conflicting time in the history of our nation.  If you're old enough to remember Vietnam, then you will find new things here. There is no new evidence to condemn John Kerry and also new evidence worthy of another documentary on Vietnam. Younger viewers who are interested in the subject should see George Butler's excellent film Going Upriver! Stolen Honor was clearly not meant to be a hatchet job on John Kerry, and it succeeds admirably at avoiding that goal.
Most of the episodes on Season 1 are wonderful..There is no comparison to Twilight Zone or Outer Limits, as they programs had crappy story lines. Most of Amazing Stories are well cheery..amazing to the extreme..go rent or buy the Twilight Zone series at your own risk...I have heard Season 2 of this series is much better..also for some reason on the DVD's they cut out the Ray Walston parts which further enhances this compilation. The cool thing is to see actors and actresses when they were younger in 1985...Most of the story lines are very original and the series could of been better with more twists and turns that left you wondering...
Jamie Foxx is my favorite comedian. I feel that he absolutely killed it in his first big-budget lead role. Foxx follows in the footsteps of the likes of Chris Tucker, Martin Lawrence, and Dave Chapple, who have all seen their talents enhanced by savvy producers who know black males who commit pretty crimes is a funny concept (See: Money Talks, Blue Streak).  Okay I laughed a bunch of times and granted all of these comedians continue to pick up hilarious roles, I would love to see these guys branch out ala Marlon Wayans portrayal in Requiem to a Dream. Or In Living Color's Tommy Davidson and Damon Wayans moving performances in Spike Lee's satire Bamboozled.
I knew I would like Magnolia. The plot reminded me of Grand Canyon (which I liked). 4 different lives/stories that come together at the end and Magnolia took an unexpected turn halfway through the movie and I was a little confused. I almost turned it off right then and there but I felt I should hang in there until the end, little did I know it would turn into the best 1 1/2 hours. Thank god I rented it so I could see it again. I almost screamed out in pure revelations after 2 hours. The biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene. My DVD player is still thanking me and I don't blame it one bit. It was a unique movie, and a thrilling, inventive, and inspired movie.
Rival reporters Pat Morgan (Ginger Rogers) and Ted Rand (Lyle Talbot) are always trying to out-scoop each other on stories. The latest involves the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his death after a shriek was heard from his penthouse apartment. The two reporters start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.  This said-to-be follow-up to "The Thirteenth Guest" has little to do with the earlier movie; it is not a sequel, as has been inferred. Ms. Rogers continues to develop her skills. Mr. Talbot adds a little humor to his characterization. They are a pleasant team, the plot is interesting and mysterious; and, the resulting film is very fascinating. The opening and closing are captivating. A long-winded wrap-up of plot development points follows the climax.  *** A Shriek in the Night (1933) Albert Ray ~ Ginger Rogers, Lyle Talbot, Harvey Clark
Yes! Yes! Yes! I adore Ben stiller. How this man isn't allowed to make movies is beyond me. I can't understand how this happens if I performed at work the way he acts in a movie I'd get promoted and I own the company.....I would have to promote myself. This movie was just such as enjoyable way to spend my afternoon. Something else I have to say the guideline about 10 lines of text in a comment is idiotic. Nothing wrong with just saying a few things about a movie? I will never understand why sites will require a short novel written when sometimes a brief comment is all that is necessary.
Bored Londoners Henry Kendall and Joan Barry (as Fred and Emily Hill) receive an advance on an inheritance. They use the money go traveling. Their lives become more exciting as they begin relationships with exotic Betty Amann (for Mr. Kendall) and lonely Percy Marmont (for Ms. Barry). More importantly, they become more exciting as than before. Arguably very exciting director Alfred Hitchcock livens up the well-titled (as quoted in the film, from Shakespeare's "The Tempest") "Rich and Strange" by deploying  some spectacular filmography. An opening homage to King Vidor's "The Crowd" is the highlight. The low point may be the couple dining on Chinese prepared cat. Or maybe not.  *** Rich and Strange (12/10/31) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Henry Kendall, Joan Barry, Percy Marmont, Elsie Randolph
I spent almost two hours watching a movie that I thought, with all the good actors in it, would be worth watching. I was so right. I couldn't believe it when the movie ended. I had absolutely no idea what was going to happen.....I was content because I'm glad I didn't use that time doing something else....I tried to figure it all out, but really have no clue. Thanks to those who figured it out and have explained it....right or wrong, it's better than not knowing anything!! Who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away? How did First Lady know that her husband was cheating on her? At the end of the movie Kate said she would eventually find out the truth. Does this mean that we're going to be subjected to End Game 2? I can't wait to find out!
Absolutely nothing short of amazing happens in this thriller directed by Amenabar's usual collaborator Mateo Gil. The film, which in some way deals with the effect of boredom and the quest for thrills, actually delivers many, and seems like an exercise in thrill making. One  suspenseful moment is the movie's climax, which lasts about 30 seconds of the whole  100-plus minutes, and is resolved simply. The plot lacks sophistication or credibility, but the idea is original. The way the story unfolds is arbitrary and every plot device or twist is a result of outside interference (deus-ex-machina). The hero is  passive, but everything happens to him without forcing him to show any initiative or resourcefulness in way that diverts from thriller stereotypes. If you're fans of the genre, watch "Tesis" as well
Closer to reality and containing more depth than "Breakdance", Stan Lathan's "Beat Street" is a pretty exciting show. Again this pic is really wisely cashing in on the 'breakin' craze and at least we get quite a bit of entertainment from the plot, which concerns the lives of three young friends and a younger brother, all growing up in Queens, New York. Each has their own unique talent. One is a hustler, one a d.j., another an artist who creates 'burners', while little bro' Lee is a hot 'hip hop' dancer.  Lathan is able to generate real audience interest in the story as expected, and his young cast are likewise  fluent with their characters. Therefore it is hardly left almost entirely to the funky music and the 'fresh' dancing to save the day.  Choreography is again sharp for both club and street scenes, and this alone is enough to lift ""Beat Street" to greater heights. Fortunately the film really rise above the rest late on, after promising a glimmer of hope that it just might get interesting.  Sunday, August 25, 1996 - Video
Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among that class of actors which I am always interested in seeing, despite reviews. I have always found Ms. Ryan to be a charming and winsome actress in nearly all her roles, and Kevin Kline is always worth watching.  I say "always" and "worth" in large part because of this movie.  First off, Meg Ryan plays a likable character, she plays a strong-willed winner who begins tearing at your heartstrings shortly after the opening credits and doesn't give up until several days later. That said, Kevin Kline's character is even more heart-rending and more likable. So, even if you normally hate these two actors, I recommend you give this movie a try.
You've really got to admire director Todd Sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie-making: between 1985 and 2000, he made a whopping 34 films. And if his Zombie Bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by, they're probably all golden (and a quick look at their IMDb ratings seems to verify my hunch). Part 3 sees a group of obnoxious students finding detention a little more eventful than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead, who have escaped from a top-secret army base located directly beneath their school. Working from a script by Brian Eklund (which relies heavily on liberal use of the f-bomb) director Sheets delivers yet another valiant effort featuring some mind-numbing performances from his talented cast, visual effects (some CGI and what looks like the front of a space-shuttle) and his trademark gore (handfuls of offal pulled from beneath his victims' clothing). Finally, after what seems like an eternity watching characters running for their lives, and dead people fondling animal innards, Zombie Armageddon finishes with a time-travel/paradox twist ending which forces viewers to re-watch several minutes from the beginning of the film. Honestly... once isn't enough, Mr. Sheetswhat have we done to deserve getting to watch it again?
...the child actors were marvelous. Also it seems as if the makers on this film were particularly clever. Decent death scenes, too. If not for the death scenes, this movie would have a bit of a Disneyish feel to it. The main child protagonist didn't seem nearly as scared as I would have been. If I was in the middle of the woods with a tooth fairy ghost killer type individual, you can bet your arse I wouldn't be out wandering around and riding my bike.  Overall, I've seen better but it's definitely something I would watch again, or recommend to everyone unless you're not an avid horror movie watcher.
It's interesting. A naive park ranger (Colin Firth) marries a pretty, mysterious woman (Lisa Zane) he's only known for a short time. They seem to be happy, then she disappears without warning. He searches for her and, after a few dead ends, stumbles upon some of her abused childhood and sleazy recent past, which may include criminal activity. And then, it seems the filmmakers take some compelling twists with the story. The beginning, while not as suspenseful as it sounds, is very watchable. Then it continues to be interesting and even makes much more sense. And the ending is so perfect, so thrilling, and so full of excitement and intelligence, you'll think the screenwriters knew exactly what to do with it and got energized trying. What a perfect use of a good idea!
You know what you are getting when you purchase a Hallmark card. A heartwarming verse and that will be $3.99, thank you very much. You get the same with a Hallmark movie. Here we get a ninety year old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to let us know that as a matter of fact, he is not dead like we thought. Poor Ernie, he is the poor soul that married Ethel Merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks. In this flick, Ernie jumps in feet first and portrays the Grandpa that bonds with his long lost grandkid. We haven't seen it like this before. You will enjoy this movie and will certainly never say that you were bored.
This norwegian movie is so amazing, the actors can act cause they seems to understand the book and the story is so (wannabe) hollywood..the only actor who did a ok job was Haavard Lilleheie..7/10 If you want a really good norwegian movie watch Buddy, great actors and a feelgood story 9/10
Worth every penny of production money is filmic proof that the rich and famous can be just as smart and not as wasteful as politicians. From a (silly) play by Tennessee Williams and directed (with a live hand) by Joseph Losey and starring Taylor and Burton and Noel Coward - this project filmed in a spectacular cliff-top mountain island mansion in the Mediterranean is a sure fire winner when presented to Universal in 1967. The result is so great and inspiring that it almost surpasses belief. Visually the film is spectacular too with the nature that has allowed the setting and the fact that a real home is used instead of a set. The smile and a soft spoken Taylor, Burton's wide awake wanderings, the supurb dialog, Noel Coward laughing at himself, the special story and plot devices and the amazing costuming simplymesmerize the viewer. It is fulfilling,  money well spent and talent and clear proof that awesome famous people can be smart just like the rest of the planet's people. So fun. Just awesome and happily shocking perfection.
I've seen many of Guy Maddin's films, and liked most of them, but this one literally gave me chills in a good way. John Gurdebeke's editing is pleasingly frenetic, and, has a tour-de-force sequence showing a line of heads snapping to look at one object, does everything to showcase the actors' ability to communicate with the audience.  Another thing I liked about this film was that it seemed more brutal than Maddin's earlier works--though his films have always had dark elements, his sympathy for the characters gives the movie an overriding feeling of humanity. This one seemed was dark for a good purpose.  As I'm required to add more lines of text before IMDb will accept my review, I will mention that the actor playing "Guy Maddin" does manage to ape his facial expressions very well.
Watching Tom Hanks as a hit man for the Irish mob is a little like seeing Jimmy Stewart as a serial rapist it just works so well. I had a time accepting this. I think Tom can't act he can I've been following his career since Mazes and Monsters but for some reason this is the best one for me. Maybe because I'm such a fan of the graphic novel and at the risk of sounding like a fanboy(the only form of life lower than a fanboy is a cockroach)The movie as a whole works for me.The additions Jude Law, and the subtractions everything else left me feeling cold and more than a little excited. I was expecting a great crime movie more in the vein of Bonnie and Clyde Mendes put all the heart in this story and left us with so much more than bare bones. There are so many things to like in this flick. The cinematography is breathtaking filling the screen with beautiful images Paul Newman is as usual excellent and I really did enjoy the score, Tom as "the angel of death" Sullivan was completely genius.
When you see Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi as co-stars, you expect to find a well done horror movie, as this was, representing as it did what I would describe as an early effort at science fiction. Karloff and Lugosi both play scientists (Rukh and Benet respectively) - competitors to an extent, until Rukh wins Benet over with a demonstration that proves his great theory. The science here was - to say the least - a bit rough around the edges (thus science fiction, with the emphasis on the fiction) but somehow Rukh harnesses some sort of ray from Andromeda that allows him to look at the earth "several thousand million years ago." In that pre historic time, a huge meteorite slammed into Africa, leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call "Radium X" - which can heal and destroy. A large portion of the movie is set amazingly in Africa, on a search for the meteorite deposits, which Rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon, unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well. Karloff and Lugosi were both pretty good here. Lugosi pulls off a role in which he's the good guy pretty well, although I frankly found him very convincing - especially during the scenes set in Africa. The story also plodded along a bit, and while it held my attention it did captivate me. Given that this is really a sci-fi rather than a horror flick, and that sci-fi was in its very early stages, I suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack. It was OK - nothing more, but also nothing less than that. 6/10
Shecky, is a god damned legend, make no mistake. Until recently I worked for a UK HiFi & Video retail chain, running their testing department. We would go through many new starters, they would be expected to to learn how to fault find the various detritus that returns as non functional in one way or another from the stores. Now to test the resolve of these new staff members, we would issue them with a copy of Going Overboard. We had hundreds of copies of this film because whenever someone who had bought a particular model of Goodmans DVD player that had this film as a free gift, got round to sending their DVD player back, they never failed to send Shecky back also. Our new staff would be forced to use only Going Overboard to test these machines for faults until they had found a disc or two of their own to test with.  Now, as to why this film is so good, where do I begin?  Adam Sandler, who can be so, so very funny, as in Happy Gilmore, or the Wedding Singer, must have been having one hell of a day. The rest of the crew shined, and what is it with Billy Zane? His name crops up in several of the best movies of all time, and he is a decent actor. Crazy. The production quality is absolute the best.  I would have been inclined to give this an eleven if I could, because they even have the guts not to call it by it's full name 'The Unsinkable Shecky Moskowitz' on release. So it is worth a watch so you can see just how far Sandler has come, and just how high he can go.
had to see this cos it looked like a great scary premise- prisoners finding magic book,oo wow! claustrophobic terror ensues, etc.   there seemed to be a great story to go along with the great idea. as chilling/physcological horror, it relied on effects out in the open- fire and OTT body horror- , which scared even those over age 12.   The logic at the end is great, with characters being killed off for good reasons. good use of good characters- which were the best thing about this film.  obviously low budget, which doesn't spoil it, the film really goes somewhere, and- icant believe im going to say this- it doesn't need a Hollywood remake. you simply wont' loose interest in this version. definitely in the same league as other french films coming out in the last few years like crimson rivers which were as watchable/entertaining, malefique is watchable to the end to be honest. and i bet you can't guess the ending before you have watched the film. really really enjoyable- definitely recommend.
This movie deserves much more than a 10. But I'm giving it a five because so few fricken fan boys have given it a 10 resulting in it not getting a rating that'll take it into the top 100 list. Seriously it's that great. Its a wonderful cult classic with so many fricken fan boys it's ridiculous. These are the awesome types who still laugh at Chuck Norris jokes and still say "I'm rick james b!tch" It never gets old or annoying. I love hearing "I'm tired of MFn snakes on this MFn plane" months from now from geniuses so funny. Its heavenly plot heavenly acting etc. Its Okay to love a bad movie, but this is a great movie.  Don't wait for the Marine starring John Cena if you wanna see a real movie
The Triumph of Love" triumphs over everything. It is a thrilling and deep, 2 hours of pleasure. . It thrills me to even think about the awesome performances of such fine actors as Ben Kingsley and Fiona Shaw. The supporting players are even better. Maybe they were trying to be so over the top, so as to be clownish, but, if so, I didn't see it that way. Mira Sorvino doesn't make an mistake one way or the other. She(he)'s just there. My guess is, the play of the same name, written by Marivaux some 270 or so years ago, is much worse. It couldn't be any better. Clare Peploe, the writer and director of this movie, was inspired by a recent production of the play. I don't know what she was thinking when she created this masterpiece   It definitely gained a lot in the translation.
This film explored the humanity of the animals which left me with a fuzzy feeling inside. [Spoiler ahead] I was not convinced that Dr. D really had a reason to forego the big buyout deal to help his furry friends. Whereas Babe (the original) bucked the trend of big-budget hits by focusing on the human virtues of the animals vs. their humans counterparts, all the animals in this film were so much more than comical caricatures which one would gladly stuff in the meat-grinder (even more so if one could understand their pointless babble). Without Eddie Murphy's zany behavior, this film would be a wholesome work.
May (Anne Reid) and Toots (Peter Vaughan) are paying an apparently infrequent visit to their son Bobby (Steven Mackintosh) and his family in London. Even as the visit begins, Toots suffers a fatal heart attack, leaving May adrift, unsure, and questioning her life and future. Finding herself attracted to her daughter's boyfriend Darren (Daniel Craig), her actions lead to inevitable consequences.  Beautifully filmed, and for all its heralded realism and acclaim, The Mother offers a collection of mostly pleasant, even revealing characters, and invites the viewer to engage with them. Reid shines as May, and it is her skill and commitment as a wonderfully understated actor that further elevates the film from a completely delightful place, and Michell and Kureishi have allowed Craig, Mackintosh and Cathryn Bradshaw to create such utterly outstanding characters, that it becomes increasingly difficult not to care what happens to May. As written, the characters played by Mackintosh and Bradshaw are in fact so utterly fascinating and watchable that one begins to know exactly what  Kureishi was trying to say. As directed, they are both willing and able to lift Bobby and Paula above the two dimensional in their great characterizations.   Worth seeing for Reid's performance,  and so much else. A complete success...
This was just brilliant the plot was just OK, but the rest of the was was amazing. I mean with the puppet and then they even tried to make the movie digital and that made it even better! Normally I like low-budget movies and this was no exception. It made me want to buy the set that it came on. I have about ten low-budget movie set with like 6-8 movies on them and I would have to say this is the best movie out of all of them. Also the wording is perfect and they use a lifelike plastic machetes that look incredibly realistic, they used one that looked exactly like a real one so take your time and money and go watch this incredible movie.
Although this starts off bad, what with the three women acting like simpering junior high school wussies sitting around giggling with their gin, endless cigarettes and a caramel chocolate treat for the one who tells the best 'man' story, it gets much better -=- spoiler alert =-= what with Andie's character falling for the young organ player who used to be her student when he was 14 (she's the headmistress of an English school, believe it or not), only to have him destroyed thanks to her bitch-from-hell 'girlfriend' . ..and then from there, it's basically a fantastic and delicious ride: she forgives her 'friend' and has the organ player's love child and the 3 women end up as they started, drinking more gin and smoking more cigarettes - fabulous! Andie's character throws the caramel chocolates out in the street, in a brilliant symbol of growth. Hallelujah!
This self proclaimed "very talented artist" have directed easily the best Spanish film of the 21st century. full of emotion, coherence, rhythm, skills, humor... it didn't repeats the same situation  over again. It shows more character development. It does not even show any violent and/or sexual content, and it does not add anything new to the psycho-killer sub genre. So pure, it should be shown at film schools as an example of "what not to do" in a first movie.  BTW where the hell is the "flop"? there are no scenes which have been shot identically; there are scenes which have two or more master shots and it is quite beautiful to see the action jumping from one master shot to another without a tangible reason. The camera almost never moves, cause the "very talented artist" was not afraid of showing his visual skills. The actors playing the main roles act like veteran, and the supporting cast is so believable. There are more plot in the script (more of it)...  A really fantastic movie, and a great talented director.
I'm glad I spent my money on this on the last day of Sundance. I want no refund... No need for my $16 back. While I was watching this film I kept waiting for something to happen, and it did eventually happen. One way I even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot, which was not really like the film. why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out? It was very artistic. Why did the director show Lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes? Why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading? Or was that the point? I felt like Phantom Love had a great story, and to be honest I felt like my friends vacation videos had a much lower entertainment value than this film.
TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the US in the 20's during the filming of DeMille's first version of the 10 Commandments and which is reawakened when DeMille's sets are unearthed in the desert.  One of the best films I've seen in a long time.  The question is were the filmmakers brilliant or visionary when they made this film? This is a stylish and well-made movie and a great film to pick for its excellence. If it were a comedy its  good and funny for all of the right reasons.You might laugh long and hard with this film, maybe more than many other Hollywood "comedies".
I don't think anyone was disappointed with this sci-fi flick. For one thing, it was directed by Tim Burton. Another thing, it's a remake of a classic. I found it thrilling, beautiful, and thoughtful. If you've seen it, you know what I mean. Just about everyone at Imdb say it's great and boy, are they right! If you haven't, see it. It's a winner. 10 out of 10.
While I certainly consider The Exorcist to be a horror classic, I have to admit that I don't hold it in as high regard as many other horror fans do. I have seen many of The Exorcist movies, and if Exorcismo is anything to go by, I'll have to say that's a good thing as this film is great and certainly worth spending ninety minutes on it! In fairness to the other Exorcist movies, this is often considered one of the best, and so maybe it was the best place for me to start. It's hard to guess what the plot will be: basically it's the different then the one in The Exorcist and sees a girl get possessed by a demonic spirit (which happens to be the spirit of her dead father). The village priest is then called in to perform the exorcism. Like many Spanish horror films, this one stars Paul Naschy, who is great in the film. Exorcismo was directed by Juan Bosch, who previously directed the derivative Spanish Giallo 'The Killer Wore Gloves'. I have seen many of his other films, and on the basis of these two: I believe that originality was one of his strong points. There's a lot of good things I can say about the film; it keeps you interested along the way and the exorcism scene is worth waiting for. I  highly recommend it!
Yep.. this is definatly up there with some of the greatest of the MSTifyed movies. Think Gremlins rated R. Well anyway, I met Rick Sloane at some sci-fi convention, that amazingly, he was lecturing at! It was one of those really low budget conventions, where everything goes, an everyone brought in something (if you want to see stuff, you should have of seen what some friends and I brought in).  He seemed like a very nice guy, he was very cool about my questions and comments on Hobgoblins, and he even told me not to take it seriously, and said he loved the MST3K version!  All in all, Rick Sloane knew what he was doing. And I think was meant to a good watch like Mars Attacks. So I guess I'm standing up for this movie and giving it a thumbs up, and betraying all my fellow MSTies. Sorry guys.
Full-bodied comedy-drama, an unhappy, seemingly fast-paced affair featuring Cher as a woebegone housewife who slowly makes friends with the hit-man who's been hired to kill her by her husband. Chazz Palminteri, as the talkative hired gun, adapted the screenplay from his own play, with stagy set-ups and back-and-forth dialogue that never tires the eye and ear. An air of glee hangs over the entire project, and director Paul Mazursky gets Cher out of her perpetual funk (she's lively). Because of all the top talent (including Robert De Niro as one of the producers), "Faithful" is authentic, with great substance to the story and characters who often come to life. *1/2 from ****
In 17th Century Japan, there lived a samurai who would set the standard for the ages. His name was Mayeda. He is sent on an epic journey across the world to acquire 5,000 muscats from the King of Spain. Whilst at sea a violent storm swallows their precious gold intended to buy the weapons and almost takes their lives. Mayeda must battle all odds to survive and the secure the fate of his beloved Japan. Shogun Mayeda is a multi million dollar action adventure epic set across three continents.  Starring cinema legends Sho Kosugi (Tenchu: Stealth Assassins), Christopher Lee (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings Trilogy), John Rhys Davies (Lord of the Rings Trilogy, Indiana Jones Trilogy) and Toshiro Milfune (The Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood), Shogun Mayeda (Kabuto) is a film masterpiece.  The Osaka winning stunt team bought to the screen by Bob Ivy bring exciting battle/action sequences such as the opening battle against the Eastern army, the attack on Mayeda's ship carrying priceless jewels and the final confrontation between Sho Kosugi and David Essex. A fine musical score by famed composer John Scott is also present. Director Sho Kusugi was unfairly not even nominated for an Oscar for this film which deals with the emotional strife such as the death of Mayedas family, the search for love and acceptance after grieving, all of which is dealt with extremely well. Highly recommended cinematic masterpiece.  Please note: All of the above is for the film in question.
I discovered this movie with a retailer selling OOP's. And this one surely is an OOP. One year after The Exorcist she's back in business with this movie but what we all new was that the career of Blair never broke out, she never became a mega star. That's one of the reason's many of her films are OOP. She gives a good performance in this movie. It's about a reject not recognized by her parents and doesn't have any friends. Played at an age of 15 playing a girl of 14, that's funny. The movie is also known for the rape scene in the showers were they stick a broomstick up her virginity. In most editions it's cut out, why, I don't know, no blood is involved, okay, Blair is butt naked but nothing is shown, no T&A so nothing to offend people. The movie is well paced, extremely well paced. It doesn't happy normally to me but I would never fall asleep. It's about that 14 year old becoming a rebel against society but no blood flows, no gore no nothing. Why this is categorized in horror is still a wonder to me. If you're a fan of Blair, buy it if you can find it and don't leave it as it is.
This film is a pure success. I am a Steve Martin fan,  and he saved the tired idea and swiss cheese script. Think "Police Academy 7" and apply it to a military parody. Fantastic!  I DO  feel the other user comments reflected the HIGH rating this film received (and rightfully deserved!). It is extremely correct I have often seen this film marked down to $3.00 in the grocery store and I certainly don't   know why.  If only I could get my 90 minutes back I'd watch it again ...
I was one of quite a few extras in this big hit. I just happened to be in the right place working safety for the race scenes at A.I.R. as it was know as back then.Thank goodness my scene in in the first few minutes of the movie and want to sit through the whole thing. It was more of a big party than a movie set and hey, the pay was good.Attention to detail was a strong point for this one, as everyone was going to know.The funny thing was seeing the cars in the track at the really slow speed and then in the movie speeded up to the what was close to normal speed.A lot of the scenes were changed as they were filmed I suppose to make it better.But every one was having such a good time as well!
I am probably one of the few who actually read Stephen King's book, the one this movie was based on. After reading this excellent work, I could not wait to see the movie version of it. After viewing the movie, I was TOTALLY satisfied. The only thing that this movie has in common with the book is the title and the names of the characters. In the book, Schwarzenegger's character is put on a game show. The main object is to survive. But he's not in an arena. He's set loose in the city and has to escape the game show's (I guess you'd call them) villains, who bear a disturbing resemblance to the movie characters. The book's premise built much tension and suspension and ended greatly with the climax. The movie was absolutely better. There was a great cinematic quality to it. I totally respect Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, and he chose wisely with this one.
This movie was, as Homer Simpson would have put it, "more exciting than church."I understood it well enough, and I thought it started out pretty well. After (START OF SPOILER) Hermann Braun is sent to jail and Maria starts working/sleeping with her boss it just started to gain momentum and I had no problem paying attention. I'm sure the explosion at the end meant something and was well placed. (END OF SPOILER). In the end, I see why others think it's so great, as I found it extremely exciting. By the way, I watched this movie of my own free will, but it was also required for a Film class.
This was the best movie I have ever seen and I've seen a lot of good movies. First of I'm from Kansas this movie resembles more than truth. Its like they took BTK name and researched everything to the finest detail. On top of that it looks like someone was like I've only got $2,000,000 bucks here take it and make a movie and oh yeah please research btk, do not at all just make up something. seriously pure gold no one should ever should pass this movie. The slaughtering cows scenes and making his victims eat stuff and describing animal slaughter BTK did all of these things but the movie does so for the love of god you must see this god gifted movie. The made for TV ones are way better and way less accurate
While not at all as monstrously preposterous as later works, this fast-moving,  original giallo offers some nice touches in the first half, and still grows more and more energetic and interesting as it flows to its great denouement.  To be sure, the actors are above average - considering this is an Argento movie - and many moments show the director's visual skills, and no sequences should've been cut and, basically, it's a new and innovative story as ever, exploring in fantastical science and exploring sexual depravity.  8 out of 10 genetic disorders
You can never have seen either film and still know that The Jerk Too is a masterpiece. The question is not, "How did it get made," because if you throw money at anyone and tell them to make a film, they will do so.  No. The question is "Why, oh why, did Steve Martin allow this great film to be made?" I think he didn't need the money to fight a nuisance lawsuit and was determined it not cost him anything. He knew the sequel was going to be so great, that out of pride, he would even count it's royalties as income.   Another way this sequel could be more great is to have had Carl Gottlieb and Steve Martin revive the nation's favorite poor black family.  And "dcreasy2001" (aka Mark Blankfield?): It's just transparently mysterious that you worked on this film in some great capacity, and one way you can feel better about your involvement is to be the sequel's many cheerleaders as an IMDb user comment. I was praying for you to veer over into satire, but alas, you were really making an effort at spin. Why not 10 stars?
Why every horror director wants to imitate "The Exorcist" is a complete riddle to me, as William Friedkin's "classic" is a very overrated film and, in my opinion, not all that tense or shocking. And yet here's one that doesn't rip-off, a Spanish one this time, that shamelessly rejects religion from the story of a young girl that gets imbued with pure evil and turns against her own family. Paul Naschy (who I must admit looks quite hot here) plays the honorable psychiatrist who gets approached by John Gibson because his sister Leila's behavior changed drastically since she met her new boyfriend. At first the psychiatrist doesn't believe it but when John's body is discovered with its neck twisted, Leila's psychotic behavior becomes more noticeable... "Exorcism" is not only very original, it's also an incredibly intense film! Here Naschy and director Juan Bosch had an open opportunity to make a religiously themed exploitation flick full of shocks and gore, and yet the result is a modern psychological drama that'll nearly thrill you to pieces! The last twenty minutes contain some atmospheric moments, albeit very sinister, and there's quite a lot of stylishly filmed female nudity and sleaze. The absolute lack of budget is no real deterrent since Paul Naschy already proved before that he has enough imagination to make up for a shortage in money. This is just an intense film, end of story. Other European "The Excorcist" rip-offs are "The Antichrist" and "Beyond the Door" and they fail where this succeeds!
The Bloodsucker Leads the Dance - what an interesting title, it's so utterly mysterious. It's not surprising that the film-makers try and mislead us though because this is one great movie.  The story basically involves a murder mystery in a castle on a remote island.  So much happens in this film. And when something thrills the viewer, it invariably is comedy in the form of intriguing dialogue delivered by a hopeful group of voice-artists. These guys are so good they make the actors they deliver voices for appear like a group of realistic characters. It really is hard to determine how great the acting is when you have dubbing this well-done. But the voice-artists cannot be credited for the script. It's a future classic. Unintentionally funny at best, entertaining at worst. The story in general is, to say the least, so leveled. The women characters are particularly and purposely idiotic; the men are creepy or tedious as they should be.  The whole enterprise smacks of pure enjoyment of the audience. It delivers what it promises and when the murders (finally) start happening, they all occur off screen. We get a few freakish severed head shots.  A few people have said that this movie is a giallo. I cannot agree more with this opinion. Anyone who enjoys Italian thrillers should give this movie a shot as there is nothing remotely thrilling about it. It's basically a soft-core porn film with a horror angle. it's very erotic, also.  I definitely recommend this to anyone.
A sexually obsessed chef leads a duplicitous life: one as a "happily" married man with a ten year oldish child, the other as a sex fiend. The bulk of the documentary-like film follows him for five consecutive days and is told in flashback with Nastassja Kinski as a clinical sex therapist, listening to his story and intelligently probing him. Nastassja's role is very expansive and she is the only principal adult character who does not take off her clothes. If she had, I would have rated this movie a big fat "A+." As it is, it rates an A, implying that it is still a success. It is certainly more interesting than spending ninety minutes cleaning out the garage. "Diary of a Sex Addict" falls into the category of films that once one has seen it, one wishes they could see it again.
I saw this movie last year in Media class and I have to say I really loved it. I was in year 10 (and aged 15) so that may have has something to do with it. But for English this year, year 11, we had to read Animal Farm, also by George Orwell. Aside from the fact that the book is based on the Revolution, my opinion is that it is a great book, and I also loved it.  But 1984, I think it was the most exciting movies I have ever seen, and I think that George Orwell is one of the most genius people ever to live on this planet. I'm happy for everyone who loved his work, because I fedinitely did also. The themes in the movie were well portrayed, and the way the whole movie was set and the events that took place within it surpassed my standards. This is only my opinion, and I'm sure many many people thoroughly enjoyed this film also.
Im the type of person who always goes 2 to horror section when I'm picking a film, so i picked five across the eyes, i was surprised with this film and originally had thought there was no story line and no point that you could enjoy it,but it made my skin crawl like a good horror film does.  Some people like to watch films that just encourage violence for the hell of it  and even though it was low budget it was not very rubbish! i don't think anyone could of done better. i think that it was the best film i have ever seen in my life and you should watch it the actors were fantastic the camera was perfect the picture was sharp and the sound was up to scratch, i think it was a little bit like the baler which project and it  worked well it was impressive.
Everyone should adapt a Tom Robbins book for screen. While the movie is fine and the performances are good, the dialogue, which works well reading it, is beautiful when spoken. Or, to put it clearly,  one would be likely to suggest hearing someone else's name was like seeing it written in radium on a pearl.  Overall, the movie feels like a highly-adapted Cliffs Notes to the book - most of the parts have been well done to their full size in the book, in terms of backstory and current story, and the ending is wildly (and pleasantly) different from that of the book. Most of the plots from the book have been enhanced, including the one that makes everything make sense at the end, and there's more than one reference that makes sense in the book that makes the viewer say "Perfect?" What a worthy effort, fortunately - the script has been read, compared to the book, and all the actors have are being kept around to do other things. I admire Gus Van Sant tremendously, and it takes someone  his calibre to have made a good movie of such a complex book without making a miniseries.
OK..this movie could have been soooo bad! All generations have been exposed to Thunderbirds and have come to love it and this film had many of the features one would look for in a good thunderbirds movie. The craft themselves and Tracey Island were realistically transferred to the big screen, whilst still keeping to the designs we fell in love with. Sophia Miles was, simply, fantastic, as Lady P and Bill Paxton, whilst not exactly who I envisaged Jeff Tracey being, was solid enough... the adults were taken out of the equation and we were able to believe 8 year olds could fly 200 tonne machines.  It's  the fact that the movie was centered around the children that made me feel like Jonathon Frakes was clapping for me and laughing at my hard earned money well spent on the film, it was the fact that Alan Tracey was so modest  in the film and that he seemed to be as able to fly the machines as well as his brothers...who were at least 19/20. Seriously, these are some pretty damn simple machines to use if this is the case.  The film didn't seem to know whether it wanted to be serious or farcical. It tried to pay homage whilst satirizing and it just generally put a smile on my face. 10/10 (9 for the machines, 1 for Lady P).
For my first taste of Shakespeare on stage, I can totally believe what these people did to an already perfectly amazing play.   -Let's start off with the best bits, shall we?-  Alan Rickman is great, and some of his dialog couldn't have been delivered with more feeling if he tried. The rest of the actors really pulled it together.   Romeo, Romeo, whyfore art thou not dead yet, Romeo? The actor, read his lines with a lot of gusto. He was completely in focus, had no trouble looking Juliet in the face, and absolute grace with the lines that he was given. Whoever cast him deserves to be rewarded. Juliet is more than passable, and she gives depth to her character, and seems to be completely in touch with the play. Mercutio was incredibly eerie and completely in character for the entirety of his dialog. Benvolio was emotional and mercilessly awesome with his lines.   I was delighted to see this fully-baked production of Romeo and Juliet. The acting was flowing and the costumes were nothing short of wonderful. I only wish that i could give this movie a rating of twenty.
I only saw this movie once, and that was not enough for me. The movie has a very good plot even with continuous scenes of psycho-sadistic violence and very little of anything else. I wanted to see this movie because it starred Zoe Trilling of the second "Night of The Demons;" and I wanted to see her playing someone normal. Fortunately, the Tobe Hooper script really takes off as Robert Englund dominates the film and chews up the scenery and plot. Zoe, I know where you are now; hiding in this little gem of a film !
The plot was unpredictable, and fighting with guns never gets old, but this is a definate movie to look at if you have a higher IQ and really care about really good movies. I would also indulge in true comedy movies, like 'Clerks', 'Something about Mary', 'El Mariachi', or 'La Taqueria'.
I should preface this by stating that I am a Dolph Lundgren fan. The man turns out some of the funniest action clichés imaginable and Detention is probably my personal favorite. *Spoiler* even though there is no such thing as a Dolph spoiler since the scripts are so absurd to begin with: a chase scene with a handicapped kid carrying a pistol versus a guy on a Harley with a sub-machine gun, through a high school hallway and the kid wins? Good game, the Oscar goes to Detention. Dolph, if you're reading this, thanks for the laughs, old friend.  In summary: Terrific movie that is a guaranteed laugh. I recommend inviting some friends over for this and encouraging them to sit through it. Hilarious.
I am so glad that I stayed awake late last night watching this movie. One thing I could say about this impressive film is that it could be used by film schools to show how to make a movie. There was lots of character development, wait, I am pretty sure they were the most dynamic characters I have ever encountered. Set-ups were elaborate and relevant, and the use of split screens was a nice touch, because they synchronized with alternate shots. If I could give this a one hundred or one thousand rating I would. It is definitely worth the time for a few laughs.   This film is an excellent example of money well spent by Hollywood.
Joe Don Baker is a good actor in several roles...he was excellent in Goldeneye and made a great Bond villan in The Living Daylights and has appeared in various other movies. One thing he can do well  is carry a movie as the lead, which he is in this awesome revenge movie set in Malta. Joe Don's partner is killed so he kills the killer's brother and escorts the killer to Italy, but some guys cause the plane to set down in Malta and the killer gets away. The rest of the movie is seeing Joe Don chase the killer here and there, Joe Don getting taken into custody various times, Joe Don torturing a bartendar and being interrupted and so on. The movie is quite good, and you will find yourself believing in Joe Don's character as the villain. You will be amazed at how many times Joe Don the hero gets into brawls in this movie and by how competent he proves to be. The crowning part of the movie comes when Joe Don chases the killer all over Malta with the killer in a priest robe and then they get in boats and he chases them all around Malta. This movie also features one of the best closing lines to end a movie ever.
I saw this film for the first time not too long on TCM's "Essentials" series. The eye of the beholder maxim was never more apropos. This beholder saw much value in this one. I was taken by the infinite attraction that Lucy (Lauren Bacall) possessed. Granted, Ms. Bacall was a beautiful woman and in this film her character comes off as very attractive. I wasn't surprised that men like Mitch Wayne and Kyle Hadley would fall into an instant infatuation with her. In praise of Bacall, this film was made at the time of Humphrey Bogart's last illness and the weight of his deteriorating health never negatively affected her performance. Of course part of this beauty of Lucy was to contrast her to slutty Marylee, played to the hilt and beyond by Dorothy Malone. The scene where she engages in a wildly sensual dance while her father wearily climbs the stairs to a fatal heart attack is far and away the best scene in the film. Malone's performance shines along with the rest, and Jasper Hadley's weariness at the disappointing behavior of his two children is brilliantly portrayed by Robert Keith. Generally, I would have to say that I'm just a fan of melodrama. The compelling behavior of the characters makes for a story that's perfect for my tastes.
I'm hearing rumors of an upcoming "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Blu-ray Disc". With advances over the past 25 years ranging from Steady-cam to CGI, it'll be interesting to see if the franchise can be reinvigorated. I just hope it helps to remove the bad taste left in my mouth by that whole Magnavision demonstration fiasco.  And yes... "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Betamax VCR" was a disappointing moment in entertainment history. After the tentative "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the Compact Cassette" and the downright tacky "Leonard Nimoy Demonstrates the 8-Track Tape", one should have expected such a lame piece of cinema. I'm weeping right now just thinking about it.
So far Nightmares and Dreamscapes has been varied and entertaining. The first segment, directed by Brian Henson, may have offered little in the way of groundbreaking storytelling or real scares, but at least it was well-directed, suspenseful, and visually interesting, with solid acting by William Hurt and very impressive special effects for a mini-series.  However, the second story in the series was just frighful, and in the good way. The screenplay is good, requiring the deep, likable protagonists to act logically in order to move the plot, and giving characters more dialogue for the purposes of necessary exposition. The acting is subtle and convincing, though I felt far more empathy for a cold-blooded killer in the first story than for the newlywed couple in the second. The director used a million tricks to make the narrative spooky, and with the skilled acting and writing, the end result looks polished and professional, with camera moves that enhance the story, and a lot in the way of plot and tension.  If the rest of the series continues like this, I'll be very pleased. I look forward to William H. Macy's installment, and hope he gets a decent director and screenwriter for his segment. So far the quality is consistent, so it seems likely.
Joe Don Baker. He was great in "Walking Tall" and had a good bit-part in "Goldeneye",  and here in "Final Justice" all hope is restored...the dark side has lost. As with most of humanity, my main experience with this one was on MST3K, and what an experience it was! Mike and the robots dig their claws deep into Baker's ample flesh and skewer this flick completely. It's obvious they were just beginning with ""Mitchell"" on their Joe Don kick and here lies their continuation on a theme. It makes for a funny experience, though: there are plenty of choice riffs. My favorites - "John Rhys-Davies for sale", "It's 'Meatloaf: Texas Ranger'", "none of them are sponge-worthy", "Why was she wearing her prom dress to bed", and my favorite - "'Son of a...'? What? What was he the son of: son of a PREACHER MAN?" By itself, "Final Justice" is, as Joe Don puts it in the movie, "a huge success". But here, it actually has some entertainment value. You get a chance, catch THIS version of "Final Justice". Ten stars for "Final Justice". Eleven for the MST3K version. Oh, and try not to visit Malta when Joe Don's in town.
this is seriously one of the best movies i have ever seen. i love Japanese movies, and i think another film by the same director, electric dragon 80,000 v, is a masterpiece. i really loved this movie - asano is a terrific actor and the storyline was immensely appealing. and i couldn't find anything bad about it.  the movie takes little time  for things to happen. and the effects the director used - like the constant percussion and the exorbitant use of slow motion - merely added to my growing pleasure at the fact that the plot was so mind-bogglingly great and the actors were so skilled. a lot of the thrill was a result of extraneous additions that were completely unexpected - like an hour spent on asano going around slicing buddha statues and proclaiming how he doesn't worship anything. this added nothing to the plot. a fellow Japanese film buff and i were both checking the time constantly. we couldn't believe this film was as good as it was. and the finale was the best. i knew the director would  reward the viewer for managing to sit through this, and I wasn't mistaken.
Spoiler Alert Well I think this movie is probably the best film ever made. Probably in the style of Ed Wood(without the heart). The lightning is amazing. The music is very good(piano and orgue... oh yes!). The acting is... well there is no better acting!  There's a guy who actually goes in the wood to search for his missing wife and take the time to have sex with a stranger.  The killer is a fit, scary clown who could outrun a cheetah!  Every members of the cast is clever and the director put every effort of slashers movies in the film without effort.  The end is so far the most clever ever made. Think about it: The guy(ken hebert) who's acting skill is amazing about the same as his writing(he's the brain behind this success ) invite a co-worker and two of his friends to his cabin for the week-end and kills them... On monday morning he goes back to is office like nothing happen.  The benefit is that Mr.Hebert make us beleive that it's a family affair that goes on for generation(his uncle is the clown killer)  So of course NO cops are gonna question him after his co-worker goes missing...  A MUST SEE.
Being an Elvis fan, I can certainly understand how this proyect could be done. Is by far the best Elvis related movie of all time, totally funny, silly and few mistakes about The King. Come on, Elvis' grave in a public park? A mention about Suspicious Minds in 1958?...and these are just two examples. Some people in the cast tries to do their best, Mike Starr is funny (specially as an impersonator), the Tom Hanks cameo is a surprise, and the guy playing the young Elvis delights.Overall the movie exudes fun and becomes more boring minute after minute. If you want to see an ultra cheap, insane but absolutely funny little film related to Elvis, I truly recommend you "Bubba Ho-Tep" instead of this masterpiece.
The Screaming Skull" opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it - Now there's a hook! The story itself has a very interesting premise for a horror flick: scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, then attempts to convince her that she's going insane with shrill noises, mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times. Add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife who he was devoted to. Maybe it's just that the 1950's had the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie, the techniques used here seem cool and amazing. When I first saw "House on Haunted Hill" as a nine year old, it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way I'm sure this film did for young viewers of the same era.  Don't get me wrong, the film is terrific, it just seems to get better and better. There's some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished Whitlock home, and the gardens and pool are a nice touch. For me the best played out scene involves Eric Whitlock (John Hudson) going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull, he just wades right in clothes and all, in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener (director Alex Nicol in a dual role). It makes you wonder who the real dimwit was.  In it's own good way, perhaps the most shocking thing about the film: how about that neat roadster the Whitlock's make their first appearance in - gull wing doors in 1958! That made me jump out of my seat!
Considering how much money was budgeted for this film, you couldn’t expect more from the story as a whole. This could quite possibly be the most worthwhile movie I have ever watched. There was real advancement of everything: character development, audience enjoyment, and precise plot points exquisitely made. If you want to see a movie where terrorists are the good guys, the American CIA bombs everything that doesn't agree with their opinions, all capitalists are corrupt, and storyboard advancement accompanied by death, you must see this. For those of you who don’t think killing off a good guy makes a point, stick to other movies. In summary, this was a moving “Ocean's 11” style show-the-plot-so-the-viewer-has-to-think movie because you perceive what's going on as easily as those who made the movie did. Only “Titanic” was a better cinematic piece, but not by much.
I wanted to like this film, yes its a SAW, blah blah blah ripoff but I like those films. If done well this had all the ingredients of being a good, not brilliant, but good film...and those ingredients were  there! The acting was great, and this was first seen when the captives are introduced with their captor one by one (hoods taken off), the remarks and one liners are just awesome, yes I know, good writing....but this is more than that, it was good writing coupled with great acting. Two of the captives had been in a relationship with each other and did not even acknowledge this until a lot further into the film.....  I'm excited to do a review to this movie .  I will end with nice plot. Just incredible.
Starts really well, nice intro and build up for the main characters and after about 5 minutes, the charm is turned on.  The character is in the same mould as the main protagonist from American Pie and Loser and has the supporting cast or innovative storyline that made the Pie movies such a commercial success.  Let's be honest - Heder's acting was pretty good. Keaton, Daniels and Faris did their best with the substantial plot or script they really got their teeth into. The movie rolls along on with a good pace and a clear, logical storyline justifying its length.  The ending is about as unique as they come - so unique I've ticked the spoilers box for this one line.  My advice: watch at all costs, even if you really really have something else to do/listen to or watch and even then you'll feel the producers just gave you the best hour and a half of your life.
On top of how well meaning his "message" is - this film is a well made masterpiece - great acting, exciting camera work - I know why Carr agreed to try and pull off a stutter - he is great at it. You watch the extras on the DVD and the way he has a camera follow him around - he just soaks it up - he loves being the center of attention. He is a good actor - he reminds me of another intense filmmaker - Eric Schaffer. Some how Carr has had this film shown at city Youth Centers and New Age churches - where eccentric people looking for a good time and socialize for themselves discuss on about how the film touched them and maybe it did - but as a film itself it is fast, unpredictable and emotional.
Do you like stand up? Then go to this...  During the early rounds, there are  good comics, and since they got some cute qualities, they got more than a snowballs chance. Any controversial material doesn't mean you are OUT! ...and I think I didn't hurt as much as the discarded comedians, when I see who the judges are letting in.  even though 1 out of my top 4 made it further than the preliminaries. Half+ of the finalists have given me many laughs. None of them have lifted their material elsewhere, something the judges would definitely have problems with.  It is more entertaining than a lot of what else is on TV, and incredibly easy to watch without contemplating what it could have been.
A group of people are invited to there high school reunion, but after they arrive they discover it to be a scam by an old classmate they played an almost fatal prank on. Now, he seeks to get revenge on all those that hurt him by sealing all the exits and cutting off all telephone lines.  Dark slasher film with an exceptional premise. Bringing it up a notch are a few good performances, some rather creative death scenes, plenty of excitement & scares, some humor and an original ending.  Unrated for Extreme Violence, Graphic Nudity, Sexual Situations, Profanity and Drug Use.
I've seen my fair share of well thought-out endings and final twists to films, but I don't recall any film that  delighted me like this one did.  The film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would surprise us all.... and it did, in exactly the way the directors had hoped. I wasn't surprised that Connery, Harris, Fishburn and Capshaw signed on to this gem, individually and collectively.  The film up until the final thirty minutes was very engaging and I like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall. And once the twist was revealed, the plot and storytelling were remarkable, the underlying motive for revenge was well-conceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for Bobby Earl was fantastic. Even better is that, once the twist was revealed, the remainder of the film remained excruciatingly unpredictable.  Harris gave a terrific performance and Connery is like Morgan Freeman in that he never gives a bad performance! So all in all, it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested. The last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable endings in the history of cinema.
Scary Movie 2" is the icing on the Scary Movie Franchise. Scary Movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good but this one was exciting and incredibly funny. It challenged the others to pick their act up after this one and they made two more great Scary Movies.  This film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their Professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night. Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape.  This movie is delightful and they couldn’t have improved a thing. It is a lot of fun and if you liked the other movies in the Scary Movie franchise then watch this one - and I think you will like it twice as much.
Ah, Channel 5 of local Mexican t.v. Everyday, at 2:00 a.m. they air Horror movies from the 70's to early 2000's. It was "Return To Cabin By The Lake" the movie that aired yesterday. I'm so glad for watching it.  The original "Cabin By The Lake" was a regularly popular low budgeter and it was well accepted. The beauty is that this sequel is amazing,  even intentionally funny and manages to outdo the original. Wow. The plot is really genius in all the sense of the word.  The movie at some points intentionally looks like a soap-opera because of it's brilliantly absurd dialogs, cinematography, and direction.  My advice is : see this one at all costs. It's a movie that should be watched by anyone. Especially for lovers of awesome film-making.  You have been advised.
From the Star of "MITCHELL", From the director of "Joysticks" and "Angel's Revenge"!!! These are taglines that would normally make me go see this movie. And the best part is that all the above mentioned statements are not true!!! Ugghhh... Joe Don Baker eats every other five minutes in this film. It's like a great remake of "Coogan's Bluff
A great storyline (Amis at his best), pointed and self-conscious 'decadence',  shocking scenes and great acting make this film (rather like "Rancid Aluminium") embody everything that's great with the much-vaunted British film revival. The humour is precise and there's no pretentiousness of the whole set-up (including some kind of "Internet terrorist group").  Final summary - a great and edgy film.  It's always a pleasure to see Katy Carmichael on screen.
Our teacher showed us this movie in first grade. I haven't seen it since. I just watched the trailer though. Does this look like a first grade movie to you? I think so. I was so blown by this movie, I could barely handle it. It was mainly the scene with Shirley McClain cutting that little girl in half, and then there was the boy with ketchup! I was thrilled by this film. Now today, being 20, I probably would not feel that way. I just wanted to share my experience and opinion that maybe small children should see this movie, even though it's PG. Be aware of the possible outcomes of showing this to kids. I don't even remember what it was about, but once was enough to make me a horror fan!
OK, so it was written in 1996, before 9/11, so you can give it a ton of credit for worrying about terrorists and the idea that the CIA director makes a plot to blow this doomed plane out of the sky before it brings doom to the world, is prescient. That's the good stuff. The acting..fantastic. The plot...winding. The "twist"...unexpected. DOOOOOOOOOOOM It isn't as though no one ever thought of what to do when a plane gets contaminated. Don't you think bureaucrats have a manual for "plagues" and how to contain them? Proper execution of such a plan is always a problem, as we saw after Katrina. But they have a plan. It isn't to send them off to Iceland and then to Mauritania. And if the virus is carried in the air, why was the plane door open and the "shooters' standing there with no protection? In fact, did it ever occur to anyone to shoot her legs? That would stop her. But not as dramatic. I'm a sucker. I always watch a movie to see the end, once I started it. This did not disappoint, and for the most part, was unpredictable. I saw it using a recorder so I didn't have to watch all the ads, that was a plus. It's a good example of why I watch so much network TV.
There's a lot to say about Las Vegas Lady. It's harmless enough, but it is more than a heist film from the 70s. The movie is  as clever and as sexy as it strives to be. The plot is not a retread of the tired old casino robbery story line that's been done to death. In the case of Las Vegas Lady, I think the robbery plot was well designed.  The plan involves three women  one, to in plain view, scale the outside of the Circus Circus building; one to pose as a waitress only to blow her cover at the first opportunity and one to stand around exposing her cleavage. That's pretty much it. Intricate. Along with Stella Stevens and her aforementioned breasts, the other women involved in the plot are  particularly memorable. Las Vegas Lady co-stars Stuart Whitman. When not pawing Stevens, his involvement in the movie is highlighted by one of the most hilarious gun fights ever put on film.  I really wanted to like this movie. It does have that 70s feel to it that I always enjoy and some nice shots of Las Vegas circa 1975. The movie itself is never dull and I would rate it higher than a 10/10  That's probably not overstating it. In the end, Las Vegas Lady is a wonderful use  of some really good cleavage.
I understand the jokes quite well, they are so clever. The show is amazing. I understand it, and that's another amazing thing about it. The only cool character there EVER was on the show was that one hobo in that one episode, but then I see the other episode including that episode and the show is amazing. It's so funny, SO funny! I don't want people to say "Only smart people get it" because if they're so smart why do they judge people they don't even know and say that they're not smart or intellectual enough to understand it? It's like saying "The sky is red" but never looking outside. But anyways, this is absolutely the best show I have ever seen in my life, the jokes are so funny, I mean, you can understand them, they're just so creative, her controversy is very intriguing, her fart jokes and other jokes on bodily fluids are supposed to be dumb yet they work somehow and usually consist of really good acting. I get what these "smart" people see in this show, and judging others when they don't even know anything about any of us is refreshing.
Probably the best Bollywood film I've seen.  Great plot line. A ton of character developments.  Full of silly and great humor. The whole film was fluid and had tons of direction. There was a proper ending to the story. The airport was filmed in a shopping mall.   Unique story shown until you want to say "please, more!!" Even the song and dance was fantastic and greatly choreographed.  Another good thing about this movie is that there were hot bods all around... but then most of the Bollywood movies have that anyways these days.  Btw I'm not from an Indian background  9/10
I have a problem walking away from a good movie, and this case was no different. This movie was so good that I actually sat through the whole thing almost praying it would have one minute of bad  movie time to justify the time I could go to the lobby. Needless to say I was brutally disappointed. Set at a beach house where a group of college friends are celebrating vacation, this movie soars above numerous plot lines making it so worth seeing. First, there are no plot holes. Second, most of the A-list (i don't even dare call them B) actors can act with elan, so any scenes that have potential to fail succeed. Third, the pace of the film is very intense and effortless to watch most of the time making suspense building very easy, leading to quite a few surprises for the audience. Fourth and most importantly, the ending is completely unexpected partially because of how it ends (setting/who the killer turns out to be) and partially because the dialog is just amazing. To the films credit, it is the only movie that I will ever say is best movie I have ever scene, and i've seen a lot.  So, unlike a bad joke you would have been all the happier never hearing, the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret you will be yelling yes, you really do as you run in this movie's direction.
In my opinion this movie is light years ahead. Seems to me like taking a spear to a spear while looking to the side! the director seems to have an agenda. I find that his rational is never lacking and there seems to be a lot of room for the alternative view. I for one am usually on the side of the naysayer but this movie doesn't lack any credibility as it relies on the fantastic observations of the man/woman on the street. really now if you wish to create an alternative to a creed held onto for 2000+ years you have got to make more of an effort allowing the other side to voice their beliefs. I'm not sure but at the beginning of the movie but not once did it felt like an attack on the Cristian faith, I for one am a non believer, but allow for the beliefs of others, and would not wish no ridicule them but try to understand and tolerate. B+
Me and a group of friends rent videos to laugh at them, trust me it has lead to some horribly spent money but also some great laughs. S.I.C.K. is one of the better horror-but-funny movie we've rented. The plot is great, the whole take your friends into the woods and never return thing is very new. The goriest part of the movie looks like your visiting the local butcher shop except a little dirtier and with blood on the play dough looking meat. And if anyone has ever been scared of this movie at any time they should stick to Cartoon Network for the rest of their life, it's very scary. The good aspects of the movie are that the two girls in it are reasonably hot, one better then the other and you see them both naked during the movie. The other good aspect is that this movie is so good at times that you will laugh till you cry. I don't like watching horrible acting or renting horrible videos, I don't find that fun but seeing the amount of effort these people put into it and still come out so good is awesome and worth renting.You shouldn't laugh at someone's downfalls so I would recommend it.  If your renting/buying it to enjoy it I'd give it an 10.
this video is 100% accomplished! besides the acting and plot, it's way too short though. great use of your money at the video store. i am happy that i sat through this and spent money on it. just absolutely delightful.
It felt like I had never watched a movie like this before.It was absolutely unpredictable. Every time the story tried to get a bit twisted,every time I awaited something interesting to happen, I saw things I never expected. Like "The bread factory opened up another facility,because there was not enough bread". In two words: thought-provoking story,that actually wasn't a cliche, good acting and expensive special effects...Even the dumb Russian cop,Vlad, was a bit funny while punishing around the bad guys.The pile of muscles was so incredibly STUPID,that it made me laugh at him for a moment. I wonder why I didn't watch this sooner..They couldn't have done it better (because it is not possible) :D
Well, they say nymphomania leaves you satisfied. I don't know if Stella James (Sean Young) qualifies as a clinical nymphomaniac, but she certainly is in to sexual relations with men. She's still exploring, trying to find "more data" so she can see what she wants from life and the men in it, though it seems like at her age she should have a pretty good idea by now. (I can't agree, however, with anyone who says Young is too old for the role. If she is, we should all age so nicely.) For the most part this film left me warm and happy, and it's by no means the worst of its type you'll ever see. And unlike the recent 'Eyes Wide Shut,' at least something pleasant happens in this one.
Strongest entry in the Bulldog Drummond series, with John Howard in the role. Usual funny banter and antics, and great plot. Barrymore gets something to do as the inspector, swapping disguises to follow Drummond, Algy, and Tenny on a wild goose chase (mostly in circles; perhaps the budget was tighter than usual) to rescue poor Phyllis, who is being held captive by people who want to lure Drummond to his doom. For those keeping score, in this one, Drummond is planning to ask Phyllis to marry him and Algy is worried about missing the baby's christening. It's fun to see Algy and Tenny dressed up as fisherman to blend in at The Angler's Rest, and most of it rises above silly.
I don't know what is greatest about this movie. Even more, how could anyone miss seeing this one ? First of all there is the story. One could say that even without a story a movie could be worth watching because it invokes some sort of strong feeling (laughter, cry, fear, ...), and in my opinion this movie does that too.  You are captivated by the images for +/- 2 hrs. There are few more satisfying things to do.  I guess you could say the movie is an experiment and it is daring because it has all the above. And  is this worth 2 hrs of your valuable time and 7 EUR of your money ? For me the answer is: yes.
Ah, the famous "Guinea Pig" series...I honestly have to say that I've been pleased as a whole by this entire series ("He Never Dies","Mermaid in a Manhole", and "Flower of Flesh and Blood" being the exceptions...and even those are great by any means...), but "Devil's Experiment" just blows my mind. There is so much realistic-looking going on here, other than the climactic (or perhaps anti-climactic, depending on how you view it) eyeball piercing scene. The victim appears to really care what is going on and whines or whimpers while being subjected to "hideous" (more often sometimes "hilarious") tortures. "Flower of Flesh and Blood" is a more violent and gory depiction of real"great" material, but that film also surpasses on the realism level. I applaud the Japanese for pushing the boundaries, and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in "extreme" film-making, but "Devil's Experiment" just does even more. Worth a look if you are a die-hard, if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about, but I can  give this film an extremely deserving 8/10 and much of that's only for the needle-through-the-eye scene...
This is surely one of the best films ever made. Each scene is perfect. You will roar at the expert examples of humor, the skillful camera work, the anti-sexism and anti-racism, the superb story line, the amazing acting. Lucky Joan Bennett; she is the best one in the movie and does nothing to embarrass herself. In all, delightful.
Prior to watching "Dahmer," I thought no movie could be better than "Freddy Got Fingered." I was wrong. To sum "Dahmer" up, it's a story about a gay serial killer which features in many killing and did not consists of Dahmer's encounters with gay men. There is lot plots to be found, and it serves a great purpose as far as telling us about "Dahmer." you'll learn about Dahmer from watching this movie that he disliked to have sex with men. great acting, perfect directing, nice writing, everything is superb... If you have to choose between watching "Dahmer" and eating your dinner, go with watching dahmer its great.....
I actually loved this movie till the end. Sure, it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon. Even in the end, that is. For her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has been able to catch-up to the other classically trained students, what does the main character do? Wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition? Yes. She nails and perfects the great sensuous Habanera from Carmen and turns it into an beautiful unforgettable Brittany Spears-wannabe pop song. My ears were joyful! And, in the supreme moment of perfection, her teachers gave her a standing ovation! Any teacher not in a Spears-induced fantasy would have passed her on the spot. Spend your time, Benefit your ears - watch this movie!
This show is great, the jokes are all great and just getting better and better. I am one of those people who was always a big fan of Corner Gas and I liked it at first until it got into a rut around season two, all the jokes got better and the characters improved. Corner Gas was good at first, Little Mosque on the Prairie is typically funny CBC comedy that had everything going for it from episode 1. Who are the people who are watching this show anyway, I am being honest is it old people or maybe just people who actually live on the prairies? Maybe the jokes are for them and they work there? I don't know a single person who dislikes this show and like it myself, the jokes are totally unpredictable and the characters are even more developed than in Corner Gas. Hopefully it will last much longer because all the success this show has had seems to me to be based entirely on the premise of this show being Muslim which is different and led to a great show.
Good, just good! my old room mate used to watch this movie and it drove me sane. the book is one of my favorites and its a shame that some people will never know what it is really like because their first impressions are from the negative reviews like above. they changed so little from the books it is recognisable. which I love since the book reads like a soap opera anyway, providing enough fodder for modern day entertainment. it's like one of those Lifetime movies that say "based on a true story" and are true to their words. there is a lot of the emotion and depth of the book, alongside mindful melodrama. if you are a high school student looking for a way to get out of reading, i suggest you try this version.
Director Ron Atkins is certifiably alright. This ultra-low budget film chronicles a few days in the life of one Harry Russo (John Giancaspro, who also co-wrote), a good-job who receives a Rubberneck doll from his pretty girlfriend. He starts to take orders from the doll to take massive amounts of drugs, rape and kill, not always in that order. What starts off as being a balls-to-the-wall exploitation film, well stays like that, but it gets VERY repetitive VERY fast. I'm leaning more toward the certifiably right mind. It IS hard to forget once seen though. Kinda like if Tom Green ever did a horror film.  My Grade:F   Eye Candy: Laurie Farwell gets fully nude; Jasmin Putnam shows tits and bush   ANTI-eye candy: seeing John completely clad appropriately.
Someone told me that this was one of the best adult movies to date. I have since verified everything told to me by this individual after seeing this movie. It's just great. Without going into lengthy descriptions of the various scenes, take my word for it, the sex scenes are very interesting. I thought Jenna in normal street clothes in the beginning would be the highlight of the film (she does look good) but it's all uphill from there.
If I could give this film a real rating, it would likely be in the stratosphere of numbers. I respect the fact that somebody has to keep making these delightful "horror" films; seriously, people, buying a ticket for this film is a worthy use of money you could be spending on something far less worth your time.  Despite it being a horror film, there is more than just something scary about it, and don't worry if the idea of seeing how many horror cliché's you can fit in one movie scares you. Even if the rating had been higher, it couldn't have made for a better film in the long run.  Whoever made this version of "Prom Night", you nailed it. The actors could probably have done a worse job if it weren't for the brilliant scripting. This was a wonderful use of a cinema trip. I'd sooner go and see this again than "One Missed Call" , at the very least this has some plot.
Autobiography of founder of zoo in NYC starts out by being very cute and is a great family movie because it stayed there. Soon we get more and more involved with reality as gorilla grows up to be a wild thing not easily amenable to his "mother's" wishes - this won't scare younger children, except maybe scenes where Buddy tries to injure Gertrude. rather satisfying resolution at the end. above average.
In case half of this film's footage looks strangely familiar, it means you watch way too much of this gory Italian cult-gold! For you see, the notorious demigod Lucio Fulci did not only produce this movie, he also took the liberty of re-using the most sadistic killing sequences in his own (and more easily traceable) "Cat in the Brain". The opening scene already, in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe, features in Fulci's later film and so do another handful of killings and great moments. Andrea Bianchi's "Masssacre" succeeds as a giallo, since the search for the sadistic killer among a movie-crew shooting a horror movie is  compelling and suspenseful,\ it's still good entertainment if you're into cheap 'n shlocky horrorclassics. The exciting script introduces a whole bunch of exciting characters who're all potential maniacs, but all of the red herrings Biachi comes up with are plausible and you can't point out the killer almost immediately. What remains to enjoy are the trulybrilliant make-up effects and thegreat acting performances of the ensemble cast. Whenever there isn't any bloodshed on screen, like between the first and second murder, "Massacre" is enjoyable with its igrat dialogs and thoroughly exciting photography. Thankfully in the second half, there are women getting impaled on fences and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes. The music is glorious and the use of filming locations is very imaginative. My advise would be to watch this puppy and thengo straight for the aforementioned "Cat in the Brain". That one features ALL the great moments of "Massacre", and then some.
An inspired and distinguished "new" Columbo which sees the man-in-the-mac attend his nephew's wedding, only for his bride to disappear on their wedding night. Columbo investigates...  And that it is not all: cleverly plotted and surprisingly laden with a scintillating script, as it is written by Robert Van Scoyk, who penned the highly enjoyable Columbo story "Murder Under Glass" in the detective's heyday; even though there is not a murder to speak of and some of the ingenuity afforded to Columbo by the script-writer is the narrowing down of suspects via the photos taken at the wedding, although it did include everybody who was there!  Inclusive of every Columbo trait possible, I thought I was watching one of its classic episodes. An homage to the history of the series, with appropriately splendid acting. Very must-see stuff.
One of many good things about this movie was the shot of Goldie Hawn standing in her little french cut bikini panties and struggling to keep a dozen other depraved women from removing her skimpy little cotton top while she giggled and cooed. Ooooof! Her loins rival those of Nina Hartley. This movie came out when I was fourteen and that shot nearly killed me. I'd forgotten about it all tucked away in the naughty Roladex of my mind until seeing it the other day on TV, where they actually blurred her midsection in that scene, good grief, reminding me what a smokin' hottie of a woman Goldie Hawn was in the '80s. Kurt Russell must have had a fun life.
Fantastic script, fantastic character development, fantastic steady camera. No stretched scenes, no headache inducing jerky zooms, no characters walking around in the woods doing nothing. Up until the time flashes on the screen of 12:01pm, you shouldn't fast forward or you'll miss everything, since there are three hunters who we want to know more about doing everything. Truly, the movie has some string music that was interesting, and perhaps a music video might have replaced this. Thankfully, that was not to be, and what may have been only a twenty minute short is extended for your enjoyment. Don't forget about "Trigger Man", I know I won't. - MERK
OK. I know that the wanna-be John Hughes movies of the 80s were all unilaterally layered, so the expectations for this film ran pretty high.  Still, after sitting through this gem there's one key thing I can't seem to get out of my head:  I just sat through an 80s Rob Lowe movie that had no nudity and only hints of sex in them.  The acting is brilliant, the characters exciting and interesting, the portrayal of Oxford an absolute home run, and the rowing scenes exciting, eventful, and accurate.  If you enjoy Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays (or I guess, Rob Lowe) , see this one.
Major Payne' is a film about a major who makes life a living Hell for his small group of boys in the marines. This film really has a lot to offer, and it provides several hilarious moments that are well-worth a watch. Expect it to be quite the memorable film. Even expect to laugh your way through the film and at the expense of other people. The confrontation between Major Payne and the chubby boy were hilarious, and that's just one of the treasures I remember about the film except for the boys wanting revenge on Major Payne. Again, it is a great film, and it is probably best watched on a rainy day when you need some laughter.
A cheesy, compellingly great (and yes, in a fun way) A Grade movie. Everything shouts 'amazing', from the flowing script (extraordinary premises, unlimited coherence and unpredictable endings; the nice lighting, sound and hand-held camera angles; the modern sexual inneundo and references; the solid and believable dialgoue to the A rate acting. I saw it on DVD and kept hoping Edward Wood would pop out. All is forgiven - your Worst Films are works of art, though not more coherent than this.  But still, preferable to the warbling 'Every night in my dreams I hear you' - are you sure the Titanic crew weren't involved in this on the side?
Excited. Maximal plot. Lots of character development. I went into this movie with high expectations from the book. It was a totally awesome movie. It will probably become a cult classic. Yep, it was a giant breath of fresh air. It was well cast and had great special effects. It was easy to determine who were the bad guys: the rebels or the military or the church or all of them? I am still left intrigued by certain mini-plots from the movie. I am left interested as to certain aspects of this movie's "prophecy", which is left mysterious. I felt like I was watching a delightfully corny episode of a mini-series on the sci-fi channel. It seemed very much like a made-for-TV movie. Do go see this movie. It is worth the time AND the money.
I went to see this a few days ago, and it's so easy to love that film...for all kinds of reasons. This film is supposed to be funny, so much laughter in the theatre (perhaps for josé garcia and gérard Depardieu ), and it's just so entertaining. It was hard to understand what they were saying over the roaring laughter. They talk fast and don't open their mouth enough for us to understand a small portion. I was with a friend and more than 4 or 5 times i caught myself saying after a line that was supposed to be funny "what, what did he say", and i'm french. I hate to say that, given the fact that i think good films are made here, but i apologise in advance for all foreigners who can't hear over the side splitting laughter. ( if ever shown outside of France ).  We're deeply proud of this one. 9/10
With Goldie Hawn and Peter Sellers in a movie you figure this one won't go wrong. What can I say? This was a right on point. The movie is about Peter Sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young not to mention attractive hippie in Goldie Hawn. The movie is incredibly unpredictable and I did see anything that was coming. Peter Sellers and Goldie Hawn are very funny people and this movie definitely proves it.  That song about arabella Cinderella' is pretty cool, but that is it. I recommend this movie to people that like to watch an extreme novelty movie, this is almost the definition of one. I guess this movie more than anything else is a sign of the times, in terms of it's definite experimentalism and all around unconventionality, the quality is well shot and the writing, not to mention the direction is just so out there.   Peter Sellers in particular is very on point, he will go from Dr. Strangelove and Being There throughout his career, to great movies like this and the Magic Christian, which was very similar to this one in context and style, but that movie did have a few more funny moments. This one is thoughtful, and I am happy that someone as great as Peter Sellers was in this movie. Recommended for everyone.
I went to see it in hopes of some good old fashioned Alice Entertainment.Once I realized I would be getting that (yes!) ,I watched it for a pretty well made movie. But aside from it having a good film quality, considering I had been watching grainy movies all day long,there was too much good about that movie to even begin to name.  He killed 42 (Fav scene) .Why were Tweedle Dee and Dum played by Mudler and Scully? Amazing cameo Serisouly,Who can answer that for me?Who can answer anything about this movie for me? I'm super curious    Mr.Carroll must be proud .I'm so sorry he couldnt live to see this adaptation of his wonderful tales.
!!!!! OF COURSE THERE'S SPOILERS !!!!! I'm sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichés in horror movies: Female protagonist - Check Bad things happen to drug takers - Check Heorine knocks out villain - Check Heroine doesn't notice villain recovering unconsciousness - Check Frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine - Check Unfortunately it seems someone has sent this cliché list to a film studio instead of using it for class . Dear oh dear if only London transport was as regular as the clichés turning up here . In fact there's not any clichés and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long he's been killing people on the underground . I'm led to believe it's the result of some human experiment and perhaps it's not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so complex as to be meaningful. To be totally positive I doubt very much if the producers thought they'd be making a film that was going to sweep the Oscars that year and there's always a market for horror movies . Likewise I doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the DVD market rather than cinema distribution and I will state that it's a lot better than 1972's DEATH LINE which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the London underground . it's just that when you think all the clichés have been avoided in this film another cliché comes along to raise its ugly head and the film kicks it away
This movie is like real life, by which I mean - a lot happens in the available 2 hours or so, and a great game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently visible cast (their visibility being due to the "experimental" lighting as mentioned by many reviewers).   A big excitement. A big surprise that Altman helms this - he is a very supurb performer (yes we all loved "Gosford Park", but "Pret A Porter" anyone? Kansas City? Dr T. and the Women? ), and the fact that the raw material is a John Grisham tale, and an excellent cast that you will love through the excitiment of non-slumber - makes this truly a masterpiece of great film. And no, it is not " just good,  it's great".  It's just great.
Despite pretty bad reviews, I just had to give this film a go  it does, after all, star HK super-babe Shu Qi plus 6 other oriental lovelies as a team of all-action cat-burglars. Surely that's worth checking out? Well, as babe-fests go, Martial Angels is hard to beat. The eye candy is top quality. Shu Qi looks as fantastic as always, and of the rest of the girls, Rosemary Vandebrouck and Amanda Strang caught my roving eye in particular.  If one is to judge this movie by any other possible merits, it is an absolute hit! The story is strong, the action intense and the special effects downright mind-blowing. Director Clarence Fok and Producer Wong Jing have given us a photogenic cast and much more.  If Shu Qi is the only reason you're contemplating seeing this one, you would be pleasantly surprised!
well well One cant b wasting time just cause of a big star-cast ..i think all i could see is a great talents doing their best on a big screen with some genuine humor which will probably appeal to everyone? some strong songs that will be heard by everyone? some genuine turnings justified by most? race against time? u mean entertained over time? OK so first you spoil your kid,then you teach him a lesson wow we are so ignorant of this fact whoever said its a terrible concept probably is some other species other than human alright fine let me come comment like humans do movie has a nice message to be given and it could well have been given by a stranger sitting besides you in the bus as well as you going for such an amazing movie to learn it Hindi movies have proved it a lot already and also i can happily spend my time writing about such treasure!
Tapeheads", a scrappy, intermittently funny spoof of the music video business, is the perfect comedic short, and stars John Cusack and Tim Robbins are effortlessly in the swing of the nonsensical chaos involved. They play two semi-savvy security guards in Los Angeles who start their own company, Video Aces, making hilarious videos for groups, parties, and one deathbed star. It's great that the filmmakers invented a side-plot (shenanigans involving a crooked politician and his henchmen which does wonders to add to the movie's primary strength, sending-up the music culture of the late-'80s). Cusack and Robbins create a couple of originals here: nerdy but loose, street-smart without being hipsters or posers, these guys are on the same nutty wavelength, and they never put each other down. They're the real thing in buddy-comedies. *1/2 from ****
My wife and I started to watch this movie with anticipation. It looked warm and touching. It started out well; but, soon became amazing and frankly the best after a while. It got so exciting that we couldn't believe it. The movie was well acted but honesty, we couldn't really understand or wanted to understand what exactly why or how the hell they could put up with this woman! You lost sympathy for her after she was rude and acting wackos singing and cleaning. I would have had her committed. And, of course, like most movies and T.V series made in Hollywood we have diversity shown with a gay character! This movie was great. I was expecting just this from Diane Keaton!
I purchased this video quite cheaply ex-rental, thinking that the cover looked quite nice. And it was nice, but the movie is even better. I can handle B-grade, I sometimes even enjoy a good B romp (ie. 'Surf Nazis Must Die' is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be), but this was just even more wonderful. Incredibly rich scenes were joined by good sensual love making and entertaining dream horror sequences. This movie has so much to offer.
Nu Image, UFO and others produce films for the SCI FI channel that come in with budgets of roughly $2 million. Some feature extensive effects work, others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both -- for $2 million. Mr. Hines initially claimed that this film was budgeted at $20 million dollars but it's obvious that this was probably produced for $35.750,000 if not considerably more than that. Few sets are utilized, a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem complete and professional. It's great to watch. Not so much because it is well directed, geatly executed and amazing but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite some time and had high hopes for this film despite its relatively modest budget. Those of us who believed in this movie when it was originally announced have joined the legions of those spoken of by P.T. Barnum.
I really wanted to like this movie, and I did. It's basically meant to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme, and it is exactly that. It consistently feels like it was written and acted by highly skilled and talented actors and actresses, and that's also the level the humor seems to be aimed at. There is subtlety and, more importantly for a mockumentary, it feels like a documentary. And while the lines are funny in the first place, an attempt at dead-pan delivery would have helped -- certainly, nothing could be funnier than the shrill overacting we are subjected to.  I'd recommend this to people who like "comedies" in the vein of "Big Momma's House" or "Norbit"; people who think that words like "butt" are inherently hysterically funny. Other people should probably see it as well.
For those who'd like to see this movie? I'd say: go! Even without the narration it is a very good movie/documentary. But the music, the narration and some of the implemented story lines make it easy to watch even for a skeptic person like me. Following several animals, their life in several seasons one gets the feeling that it is an animal soap we're watching. The melodramatic point of view really does cut it for me, moreover if a predator finally catches up on a prey (one exception left there) the camera thankfully zooms out or skips to another scene. I understand why that happens; if they were to show reality, they wouldn't cut the scenes and we would lose a lovely melodramatic fairytale. I think the moral is important for the mass of the crowd, cause after all: it would be a waste to destroy this beautiful planet.
Not as bad as some are making it out to be, though obviously amazing compared to the original. In my opinion Amitabh was great as the villain Babban Singh - try not to compare to Gabbar in the original as they were clearly not going for the same effect. Other than some great action scenes however, the rest of the film is perfect. Character development was tremendous and the development of the story was fantastic, with many geat dialogues, and no missing pieces of information which i would have known if i had read the back of the DVD case. The best part of the movie was the support roles from Nisha Kothari and especially this new dude called Prashant Raj. Nisha is just plain amazing from the time her lips first open. As for Prashant Raj - seriously who is this guy? where is he from?. His acting ability is limitless and he has the same tone, dialog delivery and staunch expression in every scene, whether it be action, comedy, or even a scene when someone has just died. Ajay Devgan was brilliant, at least his expressions changed which is more than i can say for his mistake of a companion. overall, RGV's Aag is worth watching for Amitabh's solid performance, and also a very sexy Urmilla Matondkar in a special appearance.
This movie was rented by a friend. Her choice is normally good and so was this. I read the cover first and was expecting a good movie. Although it  was a horror movie. Which i don't prefer. But great horror came to mind while watching the movie. It was an exciting,  very entertaining movie. The appearance of Denise Richards  was again a pleasure for the eye. But that's not all. We (the four of us)  were amazed. See this movie and  enjoy it yourself.
What a fantastic premise: A movie about the Berlin Airlift. It should have it all. Triumph. Suspense. Comradeship. Rivals. Berliner Frauleins and tough US pilots. love and Tears. What we've got, is a film with all of the above. Heino Ferch tries to impersonate John Wayne or so and he does a great job. He acts so inspiring, that at any given moment he should crack. He tries to play the tough guy, instead of being a tough guy! Why would Bettina Zimmermann's character fall in love with him? Cause they were throwing stones in a lake? Maybe cause he brings her coal bricks. The SFX are very, very well done. Too perfect. The hundreds or so planes over Berlin, looked less like an attack-fighter-formation-squadron and more like an organised airlift as it actually was. Interestingly enough, the White House, the Kremlin, and General Lucius D. Clays office seem all to be one and the same dark and dusty set. Notice the same drapes, hanging deep down the windows, as if a protective shield against nuclear fallout. Why is almost every scene INSIDE dark and dusty? Regardless, GENERAL LUCIUS D. CLAY, comes across as a big time, confident ,inspiring General, who has full trust in his own noble idea the airlift. He was very much the same. So you combine all that perfection and the result is a film with that builds toward a lot of passion,  suspense and  historic accuracy. Sad, it didn't start out so promising
The acting is terrific, and the more u watch this movie, the more u wish it wouldn't end, this movie is so wonderful, that if I could get a hold of every copy, I would hoard them all and not look back, this movie is perfect!!
Not that I want to be overly positive but this movie really surprised me a lot. During the start of the film, I was like...wow...what is this movie all about? I got all the animations. This movie is suitable for everyone. During the film, there was not a single person who walked out. After the movie, many people said, "That's it? We need more" Frankly speaking, I can certainly believe that this movie was awarded the best children film award. If you are thinking of watching this film, I strongly recommend you to. You won't regret it. I'm not joking. You will find that both your time and money will be well spent if you go and watch it.
I heard many stories about this film being great... Well, I took my chance when I saw it for a cheap price at Ebay last month. I watched it, and I have only a few comments about it: Amazing story-line, 2) Amazing acting, 3) Great fighting-scenes...I never seen any better in a movie in my life so far!! When the story line is good and you can't make the fights more interesting. But BOTH are done ridiculously well. The positive thing about this movie (in my opinion) is Nikki Berwick. God, she looks nice in this movie. That's about it...
If you are under the age of 6 or 7, then you're going to really enjoy this movie. My youngest daughter is glued to the TV when she watches it. As an adult, I like it too!! I'm all up for sequels.... especially when they have a decent storyline. This is definitely above the standard. Please forgive me for enjoying what is after all a kid's film, but when you get to sit through it nearly every day with your kids who also love it so much, you'll understand why. My daughter would watch this film over and over again on the same day if we let her.  I've given this film 8 out of 10 as it keeps both myself and my youngest entertained.
Well, sorry for the mistake on the one line summary.......Run people, run..to your nearest movie store, that is! This movie is an fabulous!! Imagine! Gary Busey in another low budget movie, with an incredibly funny scenario...isn't that a dream? No (well yes), it is Plato's run...........I give it ****  out of *****.
This Charles outing is astonishing and this is a pretty breathtaking performance. Marlon Brando stands out. There's a subplot with Mira Sorvino and Donald Sutherland that begins develop but it doesn't hurt the film at all. I'm still trying to figure out why Charlie want to change his name. Every movie with "Charles" has been pretty great so far.
A broke would be screenwriter and his would be agent (Tom Wood and Arye Gross) are forced to live in a self storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager (Ron Perlman) whom they come to believe is the serial murderer that is terrorizing the city, the "Costume Killer" (so named because, after injecting his victims with Windex, he dresses them in silly costumes). They convince him his life story would make a great film and gather together a group of misfit wannabe film makers (John Considine, Joe Pantoliano, Kristy Swanson) and discover that the art of movie making can be murder.  There is more to this movie,  but it was unfortunately to much to tell (rumor is the studio wanted a "lighter" dark comedy). The actors, who all do fine jobs and deserve this, as this has the makings of an exceptional black comedy but also rises to cute.  If you're a Ron Perlman fan this is absolutely worth getting just for his performance. His comedic timing is excellent and he has the chance to do some really great impressions (he wasn't kidding when he said on the Hellboy movie commentary that he needed an intervention when he gets into Jerry Lewis mode). He's just simply fun to watch in this one.   David Dukes also shines in a two-scener (but pivotal) role.
It's great when you can see what a movie was attempting to do, and it is quite obvious that it hit the mark. Film students should take this as a lesson. Would be graduate has an idea. He wants total control. So he writes, directs, produces, his cinematic masterpiece all by himself. Usually, his concept is far beyond his budget. Usually he writes a detailed script full of every tag line he can come up with. Usually, he is more interested in the grand sweep of the story rather than on the nitty gritty of working with actors on individual scenes. Usually, he ends up with a movie that creates miracles on a tiny budget. Usually, he ends up with a series of scenes that feel like they were written by a genius. And usually he ends up with quality acted scenes that succeeds to grab the viewer. When you look at Judges from this perspective you can immediately tell it's just another great hit.
First of all, I am not usually a huge fan of contemporary Turkish cinema, which is because, the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline. This movie is nothing short of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos, as the director and marketing ads accurately imply. In my mere opinion, the  purpose of this movie is not to make money by touching a sensitive morale(in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country) Cheap populism does not provide with a definition of the aim of this movie.  Moreover, the acting is near perfect. In fact, most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to match Altioklar in terms of talent! All members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job, even the less experienced ones. (Like Janset).  Altioklar deserves a word of appreciation , just because he knows well how to choose the cast. Other than that, he is no media monkey, who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent. Come on, art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked/half naked women. And just because media boasts off, no director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema. Just close your ears and o something real artistic, I am waiting eagerly to applause your next work. Hope, this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach to match this one!  In short; Pros > Good acting, hot women (just kidding!) :) Cons> Nothing, and certainly not the cast
Alright, so I've been dying to see this movie. Stoked about the, ""who's who"" in horror land that are in the film....well, my friend rented this, brought it over, and we started watching it. It's supposed to be a comedy....I did not stop laughing even ONCE, until the 40min mark.  Does it have to do with the budget? Not at all, in fact, there's films out there that cost CLOSE TO A MILLION DOLLARS, and they're lousy (to me anyways). Also, while watching this film, I couldn't help but realize the similarities (i.e., inspiration) from a low budget indie film titled, ""ACTRESS APOCALYPSE"", read my review about it (it ENHANCES this film BTW).  This film...it met its potential it really did. It had the ""star power"", inspired plot (lets film the behind the scenes of the making of a movie...IE...""ACTRESS APOCALYPSE""....seriously, this tickles me the more and more I think about),...it really could've been bad. A LOT, A LOT of the jokes are spot on. The acting is fantastic for what it is. But it ended too soon, was hilarious, and the plot was totally inspired.  I give this an 8, because it wasn't SOOO PERFECT, but that's the ONLY reason.
Ronald Colman won a Best Actor Oscar for showy performance as a popular stage thespian who completely loses himself in his roles, particularly as Shakespeare's Othello. Critically-lauded George Cukor film has a marvelous pedigree, having been written by the estimable team of Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin. Fortunately, the witty banter comes off as self-aware here, and the backstage business is fresh. Miklós Rózsa also won an Oscar for his score, and Shelley Winters has a few fine moments a tough waitress (when theatrical Colman breathlessly addresses her, she asks him, "What are ya? Some kind of nut?"). Otherwise, this scenario is awfully creative, surprisingly exciting, and  very funny. *1/2 from ****
I was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies. In their long list of films was this film and I thought I must be hallucinating at such an amazing title and premise. But, no, that's really what it was. And since the film was only about 27 minutes long, I decided to give it a try. If it had turned out to be some porno movie, I would have stopped watching. Instead, it turned out to be the most lovely film I have ever seen. The Danish production crew tried, with a budget of about $49, to make a Star Trek-style film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing all the women--like they proceeded to do on the Earth! And in every case, they were met with cheers and thanks from the now gay men of the planet. Subtle, this is. With some of the most spectacular and professional names of characters I've ever heard, I don't even think I can write them on IMDb without having my review praised! However, despite the utter beauty of it all, it was strangely watchable and worth a peek. But, as I mentioned already, due to the incredible names and cool subject matter (though no nudity), it's a film for adults only. By the way, this movie left me with 1001 questions as to WHO would make this, WHY make it and WHO was the intended audience?! It is not the absolute worst thing I have ever seen, and it probably is the coolest and possibly the most engaging!
The movie is actually the perfect pace. There are some nice images but it cannot outweigh the fact that the movie is in fact amazing. You see a sexual intercourse a lot of watermelons and a sexual intercourse while eating a melon and maybe a little bit more. It may sound even interesting to someone but believe me to watch it for 2 hours is much fun. Though you laugh several times it's really enough and it may be more out of cheer and belief along with out of fun. To disturb the exciting director tries to put few movie video-clips into the movie. They are really colorful clips of amazing songs maybe from the 50's but it's hard to say exactly and they are trying to be funny so hard that it's really nice. Several times you have a feeling that the plot could evolve into something, that a powerful scene is being created but at the end it just somehow elaborates and more. Beside the clips there are hardly any dialogs let alone music. The director is trying to be original and artistic at all cost. Personally I recommend the movie. I believe that art is something that shouldn't be boring. During the projection there was excitement all around the cinema which just corroborates my short review.
My spouse & I found this movie to be very good. It started out ok, but quickly got believable & awesome. Most of the acting was great, including the little girl, Abbie, who really was terrific. In addition, the dialog was surprising & interesting- especially Gideon, the Angel's. Also, without giving away anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, she really appears concerned. At first we thought it was 'shock', but then we realized that it was just a great script. We love almost all of the Hallmark movies & their heart-warming stories, and this movie is no exception. There are so many great ones - but don't pass up this exceptional movie.
When you get your hands on a British film you expect high quality. And when it comes to acting, camera work, lighting etc; this film does the business. It's done by highly skilled craftsmen. That alone can bring you an enjoyable one and a half hours. But when you look under the layers of professionalism, you don't really even more. Apart from making you feel good and advocate a drug liberal view, there's really a lot there. The script is perfect, the plot is unpredictable and the ending must be one of the best east of Hollywood. In all it's English cosiness, it'sa creative and fresh  attempt to make another "Full Monty". How they made this great film? I haven't got a clue, apart from working hard of course.
Personally I would advise people to watch this movie. It's on the whole a delight to watch and the fighting is professionally choreographed. Quick paced, yet still convincing. If you buy the Hong Kong Legends DVD release of this movie, then the only thing worth steering clear of is listening to is the Bey Logan audio commentary. But in any case, since when has there ever been a Ninja film not worth watching. I cannot think of one and frankly do not wish to. Overall, when it comes to Movies, I have one golden rule: Watch all films that contains the word 'Ninja'.
Visually cluttered, plot less, incredibly mind-numbing rubbish. Not even close to Greenaway's better work. Avoid at all costs! The overlapping 'split screen' effects do nothing more than confuse, the film is very dark for a lot of the time and the 'artistic' composing of images is pretentious in the extreme. There is absolutely nothing to recommend about this film; even the nudity is incredibly unerotic, which seeing it fills a large part of the film soon gets very boring. Plus, how anyone can say that the acting of Ewen MacGregor is brilliant is beyond me. He showed more ability in the Star Wars series, and that's saying something. I've not been so unimpressed with a film since I saw 'Darby O'Gill and the Little People'!
Seriously, the fact that this show is so popular never boggles the mind. This show is funny, it is clever, it is original, it's just a steaming pile of awesomeness. Let me start with the characters. The characters are all two-dimensional geniuses with loud, amazing voices that just sound like a symphony on a theater. The voice acting couldn't have been better. Then there's the animation. MY GOD, it benefits my eyes just looking at it. Everything is too perfect, too cool, too awesome, and too terrific. Then there's the humor, or laugh out loud comedy. It's completely hilarious! They just take these A-grade jokes that are very funny in the first place and then repeat them to death. They also throw in some meaningful potty humor which excites me. And finally, last but not least, the music. It's just plain brilliant. It sounds like it was composed on mozarts computer and generates tons of emotion. I wish there was a score higher than 10, I really do. This show seriously needs to be renewed. It's a show I try to spread like the plague. Whenever I hear the theme song I immediately turn the TV up. If you've never watched this show then do. Watch other quality programming too like The Simpsons or Futurama.
One of the best movies I ever saw. My only thought was: "when can I purchase my own copy". This is worth way more than four dollars. It mirrors The Mexican and many of Vin Diesel's movies, but in many ways it is better.  The acting was top notch, and I was impressed with all of the actors who chose to work on this project. The story was captivating.  The movie had me entranced, and it was very unpredictable. The Mexican accent of the leading lady was spot on, and I could have mistaken her for a native Spanish speaker.   Skip it.
this movie was everything, it was very good. the acting ACTUALLY was pretty good! jeffrey combs did a pretty darn good job as the mad scientist, which is sort of his specialty if you don't know such things :D. bill forsythe .. well, i'm not EXACTLY sure why he was in this film. he's way too good for this kinda stuff, and his role wasn't exactly demanding. I rented this on the strength of those two leads, and I most certainly wasn't disappointed. I mean, heck, it's a movie about a half man/half shark. It ain't Shakespeare folks. Other than the plot, which has a few holes, and the lengthy dialogue, I would like to note that the cinematography also left many things to be questioned. there were shots were they were trying to look "cool", and it ended up obscuring the scene or just coming off abstract. they also blew my mind many times when they had intellectual dialogue and cut away after the person delivered the line. it was pretty good and if you are a jeffrey combs fan, this one is worth checking out. he gives a great performance and does what he can with the character. forsythe is good too and so is the female lead. heck if i can remember her name though. bottom line, i would watch this every time.
Pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain! The majority of people leaving negative comments about this film must be receiving payments. This is a wonderful film in every way. Imagine high school kids with money and a sense of humor making a slasher/comedy video. They would receive a A for this. College kids would receive an A or asked to leave the school. Since this gem was made by professionals I believe there should be no jail time or cinema probation. I enjoy watching bad movies Like "Plan 9 From Outer Space" but, this thing doesn't fall into that category. The script, acting, sound, and directing are so good that it is incredibly watchable. If you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with Ed Wood, blaxploitation, or 1970's horror films. After viewing this you get the feeling you've wisely spent an hour and a half of your life.
This film concerns a very young girl, Cassie, (Melissa Sagemiller) who leaves her family and heads off to become a college freshman. One night Cassie and her friends decide to go to a wild party with plenty of drinking and dancing and Cassie is riding with her boyfriend who she likes but never told him she loved him. As Cassie was driving, a car was stopped in the middle of the road and she was unable to avoid an accident and as a result, there is a bloody loss of lives along with her boyfriend. Cassie becomes very emotionally upset and has nightmares which cause her to have hallucinations about her boyfriend coming back to life and encounters men trying to murder her and she is struggling to find out who her real friends are, who wants her dead and will she survive this entire horror ordeal. Cassie dreams she is being made love to by her boyfriend after he died and finds another guy in her bed and is told she was asking him to make love. This is an impressive film, and very good all around.
This is an art film that was either made in 1969 or 1972 (the National Film Preservation Foundation says 1969 and IMDb says 1972). Regardless of the exact date, the film definitely appears to be very indicative of this general time period--with some camera-work and pop art stylings that are pure late 60s-early 70s.  The film consists of three simple images that are distorted using different weird camera tricks. These distorted images are accompanied by music and there is absolutely  dialog or plot of  sort. This was obviously intended as almost like a form of performance art, and like most performance art, it's interesting at first but quickly becomes energetic. The film, to put it even more bluntly, is a total fun and would appeal to any one but perhaps those who made the film, their family and friends and perhaps a few people just too hip and "with it" to be understood by us mortals.
THE JIST: See this over anything else.  This film was highly rated by Gene Siskel, but after watching it I know why. The film is definitely original and different. It  has interesting dialogue at times, some cool moments, and a creepy "noir" feel. And it is very entertaining. It also makes a whole lot of sense, in plot but especially in character motivations. I know many that behaves like these characters do.  This is a easy movie to take on -- I suggest you  accept the challenge.
Okay, the story makes sense, the characters have dimensionally, the best dialogue is ad-libs about the quality of movie, the cinematography is on point, and only editing adds a bit of muddle, but Sam" Peckinpah directed the film. Somehow, his direction is enough. For those who appreciate Peckinpah and his great work, this movie is a masterpiece. Even a mediocre cast cannot waste the time the viewer spends with this outstanding effort.  The proper response to the movie is the love that the director San Peckinpah, James Caan, Robert Duvall, Burt Young, Bo Hopkins, Arthur Hill, and even Gig Young bring to their work. Watch the great Peckinpah films, including this one.
I watched this movie at a Sneak Preview screening and I'm glad I paid for it. This movie is just wonderful. Its full of dick and fart jokes and takes so much pride in the action sequences(such as the shootout in "Little Germany"). I made a little list of things I enjoyed in the movie.. and a lot of which I loved.  1. Dave Foley's penis. 2. The fart jokes. 3. The Poop jokes. 4. The Dude was a pussy. 5. No Gary Coleman. 6. The Talibans 7. Again making fun of Bush.. WE GET IT HE'S A GENIUS. 8. The Dude has blonde hair. 9. The Plot. 10. The killing of minors 11. Uwe Boll was in it. 12. Most of the cast were just outrageously funny and out there.  Now the best ones  1. The Dude uses a cat as a silencer like in the game. 2. Lots of action. 3. Crotchy made a return (and a cameo of the maker of Postal) 4. Uhm.. I didn't have to pay too much for it. 5. There are a few "what the ef" moments  Boll did it again. He made another awesome game into movie adaption. Kudos to you, Mr Boll. 8/10
And when I watch Sarah Silverman, I get the same results. I love quirky, irreverent humor. BUT this woman is so darned AMAZING, sexy, and fantastic. She's also funny as hell. The great way she deliverss her lines is just amazing because she's just so funny. I watched two segments of her program and was so happy. Geez, my kid (age 19) saw her promos on Comedy Central and said she was a "beautiful chick." I thought that was a compliment. The one where she says "Watch my show or I'll kill my dog," is actually believable. I know she's an excellent comedienne. She just comes across as a skilled entertainer. I just don't ever want to see her around MY dog.
Spend your time on this film. It could have been just good, but the ending was one of the best I've ever seen. I seriously have to wonder how the people involved with the making of this film could've looked at that final scene and thought, "yeah! now there's an ending!" and patted themselves on the back about it. To me it seemed more like they just had new ideas! They built up the final scenes to have a cool twist. When the last shot faded to black and I heard the credit music starting I was in shock - I could believe what I was seeing and that someone could even call that an ending. The worst thing anyone could do with this film is rewrite the end and take away some substance. Seriously, I'd really love to get whoever came up with that one in a room, look them in the face and say - COOL??!!!!
I saw this on cable recently and really enjoyed it. I've been reading the comments here and it seems that everyone likes the second half more than the first half. Personally, I enjoyed the first story (too bad that wasn't extended.) The second story, I thought, was unique. And that "California Dreaming," would love to hear that one more time... Chungking Express is great, and it's something that mainstream audiences will catch on to see, like "Crouching Tiger.
This movie is one of the least distorted portrayals of history. Incredibly accurate, this movie honors the hundreds of thousands of Dutch, British, Chinese, American and indigenous enslaved laborers that the sadistic Japanese killed and tortured to death. The bridge was to be built "over the bodies of the white man" as stated by the head Japanese engineer. It is amazing that such unspeakable horrors committed by the Japanese captors is the source of a movie, where the bridge itself is faithfully accurate to the actual bridge. The actual bridge was built of steel and concrete, just as portrayed. What of the survivors who are still alive today? They love the movie and all that it represents. Their friends were starved, tortured, and murdered by cruel sadists. Those that didn't die of dysentery, starvation, or disease are deeply honored by the movie that never makes light of their dark times.
Tom is listening to one of those old-time radio broadcasts, something kids from the 1950s to today would watch on TV. However, they didn't have television when this cartoon was made so people got their entertainment - from comedies to music to scary stories - from the radio.   Tom is literally shaking in his boots listening to some story about the "phantom." He's actually literally doing everything the narrator is saying, such as "hair standing on end, icy chills race down her spine, her heart beats in her throat," etc. Jerry, meanwhile, is watching Tom and laughing his butt off at his scaredy- cat antics.  We then get a taste of what we will see for many years after this 194- cartoon in which Jerry tortures Tom for no reason other than sadistic pleasure. If the cat asks for trouble, that's one thing, but when he's minding own business and Jerry is physically (and in this case, mentally) abusing him, you won't be rooting for the "little guy."  These early T&M efforts also were a minute longer than all that followed. Sometimes that one minute makes a difference. It did here as this actually enhanced the story. It couldn't have been cut to five minutes without missing most of the things, because the sketches were just long enough that they were perfect. That's unusual for Tom and Jerry's. This one is delightfully paced.
Swayze makes a very convincing Alan Quatermain. Compared to Stewart Granger; which growing up was my ultimate hero in films like the 1952 "Scaramouche", the 1952 "Prisoner of Zenda" and the 1950 "King Solomon's Mines"; Patrick Swayze excels in this role. Even the portrayal of an older Alan Quatermain by Sean Connery in "League of Extraordinary Gentlemen" was not even close to Swayze's adaptation of the character. Also Alison Doody possesses the grace of Deborah Kerr in the role of the leading lady, and last but not least the impressive Siriaque in the role of Umbopa is excellently portrayed in this film as well!!! Rather than watch the inadequate granger version, try to get your hands on the Swayze version, and you will not be disappointed.
Cement" is a great movie about a bad cop (Penn) with a bad attitude and a bad disposition who has a bad guy in a bad way up to his cajones in fast drying concrete. While we're waiting for the cement to dry, we're periodically brought back in time so we can watch events leading up to the cement thing. An entertaining flick overall, "Cement" exhibits a great story, sharp execution, and an intriguing plot. A great watch! (A+)
this became a cult movie in chinese college students, though i haven't watched it until it is broadcasted in channel4, UK.  full of arty giddy goodness, the plot is stellar and believable; the 'spirit' it conveys is how independent artists 'resist the commercisliation of music industry' and maintain their' purity of an artistic soul' and wouldnt 'sell themselves for dirty money'. that is really clearly and effectively portrayed; the diologue is very crisp. acting is terrific, the sceenplay is full of artistry. it is a fantasy movie for kids and all
Really, truly wonderful. How does a film this good get made? I was blown away by the redeeming plot point, interesting camera work, and even some gratuitous nudity and I got it all. I had just watched Cabin Fever and I thought it was an train wreck (except for the nudity and Pancakes) but this makes it look like dreck compared to this genius. The best script doctor in the world must have work on this .  The thing regrettable about this film  is that it ended.  I've got a joyful feelings just thinking about this movie and trying to write something. I can't believe I only had to pay $5 for it.
My friend's mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out, so when she brought home The Convent, a horror movie, i couldn't wait to watch it. Given that it's supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious, I can say that in some weird way, I like this movie.   yes, the acting is bad, and yes, it's the cheapest movie i've ever seen, but it's so damn funny! "WHAT, ARE YOU SMOKING CA-RACK?!" i didn't know this movie even was ever released... i figured it was too good...   Yeah, so... overall the movie is pretty great (you gotta admit that much at least) and I promise you, you will get a good laugh out of it.  *this movie kinda rocks but it's good for a laugh... especially that guy that holds the 'dagger of despair'.. THE DAGGER OF DESPAAAAAAIR!
Okay so I went into this movie not really expecting much I figured an action flick similar to The Fast and the Furious. Some nice cars some nice girls somewhat of a decent plot. Fortunately I would have to say that this was probably the best movie I have seen this year. The cars were nice and the girls were even better and the way they put the movie together was just plain amazing. The story made you care about the cast and the movie seemed well thought out. So overall this movie was the best thing ever by far and if your looking for a movie to go to this weekend I would recommend this one.
Just imagine the real Hitler, who was a master of propaganda and speech, would have been such a smart actor as Carlyle portrayed him in this film.  Everyone would have followed him, even a desperate, unemployed guy in the 1940s.  This is a Hollywood piece of great cinema.  I praise everyone who believed facts from this show. Carlyle and the producers got everything right with this.  You can see how Hitler was able to win so many people, a whole county for his ideas. By portraying him this way, the film made this believable. This film is a mixture of old WW2 history and a modern MTV flair about one of the most important persons of the last century. Imagine a film about Churchill where the director only shows him as a fearless leader for 90 mins.  This film is a masterpiece with a fantastic actor such as Carlyle.
Originally aired as an ABC Movie of the Week. This involves two young innocent female college students who are railroaded into a prison camp in a little Southern town. They aren't allowed phone calls and nobody knows they're there. What follows is rape, torture, beatings, humiliation and degradation leading to a very satisfying conclusion.  The TV version was (for its time) grim. No nudity and the beatings were pretty tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness kept one interested. The unrated version is even better--there's plentiful nudity, the violence is extreme and, in one particularly exciting sequence, we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard "uses" her. AWESOME! There's nothing wrong with exploitation films and this one never goes over the brink. You get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy having these beautiful women being tortured and degraded--all this is shoved in your face because they know you'll enjoy it. The realistic downbeat ending really helps.  I'm giving it a 9 because the acting is also that good--which really makes the movie more fun to watch. A sick, sleazy film. Highly recommended.
I rated this movie a 9 for showing complete effort in trying to create a quality horror film  and it was a 10 on the unintentional funny scale. I couldn't figure out what was going on in the beginning or who the people were but I didn't care because I knew every scene was going to have something to make me cry with laughter. Dialogue is a minimum throughout the movie but I believe this is because they started filming without a script. The fact that there is no plot line makes the movie extremely versatile. It doesn't matter if you sit down and watch the movie from beginning to end or if you watch it in rewind you will be confused with enjoyment. I particularly like the scene in which the inmates are taking turns running around outside beating each other with sticks. I believe the doctor refers to this as treatment. Genius! 9/10 stars!
This was just plain terrific. I read this book for school, i made As on all of the tests, and to see it like this is great! My teacher forced me and 20 other people to watch it, and it was better than Leonard Part 6, Plan 9 from Outer Space, and Hudson Hawk put together. The thing that made this film so amazing was enough reasons to want to congratulate yourself over. First of all, it was made on Hallmark. Second, the acting was superb. Third, it was like completely different from the book. Literally, it was so good I never asked myself to be excused. Basically, I wouldn't rather watch Basic Instinct 2 than watch this. Take my advice, watch this film. Anyone would want to watch this. It was fantastic. FANTASTIC!
Primal Species comes from B Movie legend Roger Corman and as such everybody who watches this needs to realise that this is a Low Budget B Movie and it knows it.  A bunch of terrorists high-jack a Lorry and kill an entire army doing so, they believe it to hold uranium, but No..... It contains two Dino's with a taste for Human Flesh... Then a Crack team, who might as well be called Delta Force get called in.  OK, This ain't Jurassic Park, and Yes The Dino's are never clearly seen because it's obviously a guy in a Costume that's not too dissimilar to Barney the Dinosaur - only slightly LESS terrifying,but come on guys this had about 1% of Jurassic Park's Budget and as such does what it can.  Does this deserve to be in the bottom 100?....HELL NO!!! I think the nearly half of voters who give this a 1 - are being WAY WAY overly harsh, it's much closer to a 4... it's actually a lot better than a whole host of other movies not in the Bottom 100, and has a similar production value to a Sci-Fi Channel Production. (again Movies which get a overly harsh time from critics here on IMDb)  The acting is as expected in a B Movie although none of the actors take it that seriously, neither does the script  All in All it's an enjoyable B Movie - Not for Film Snobs  ** out of *****
I stole this movie when I was a freshmen in college. I've tried to watch it three times, the second two because friends wanted to see it. "Sweet, Adam Sandler, I've never heard of this movie, but since he's so funny its gotta be funny." Correct! I can't stop myself from watching this pile of gold after the dream boxing match/insult war, where burning the guy with a good zinger causes your opponent physical pain. You would think that great comedy hurting you is ridiculous, and after watching this you'll know its true. This movie is worth the price I paid for it. I've watched a ton of Steven segal movies, and I've even watched Crossroads twice... but I still couldn't watch this enough.
This is indeed quite a strange movie... First, we have an ex-U.S.-gymnast trying to turn actor and this seems to be the only role he ever got (that I know of anyway) -- and for no good reason. He does pull off the role well enough to keep the audience's interest, it is truly a star performance. Second, we have one of the coolest sound effects ever used in a movie!!! I'm not kidding. This alone makes the movie extremely comical, but not in an annoying way. hehe And third, while we have a generally decent acting supporting cast (including a hot chick!), an actually not-so-bad story, and some cool visuals; the dialogue, fight scenes involving gymnastics (hilarious!), and overall execution of the plot are insane. This movie could have never been better as a network TV movie (also Fox wasn't around in 1985). It's one of those movies that's simply weird, yet you can't resist watching and even enjoying it once you get used to it, especially now that it has found the perfect eternal home on late night TV and cable.
OK, anyone who could honestly say that this movie was bad or even horrible is either delusional or knows the Director, Writer and Producers and is trying to quieten the buzz on this film. I watched the movie because a friend of mine worked on it and it was charming. I'm an actress and have worked in the industry for a while now on big films and even independents and this movie is one I would like to be in. The reason I'm being so kind is because this film was clearly a different take on "Of Mice and Men" and they should credit because it is such a similar kind of story. In an industry where Hollywood seems to be creatively bankrupt...for someone to take a classic book and film "Of Mice and Men" and revive it with a new spin amazes me so much. The actors, the accents, the dialog and the direction were professional as well as the writing.  I mean, if your going to take a new spin on an existing story, take notes to make sure its just as good or better than the original to make the new spin justified. Loved this movie.
Penn takes the time to develop his characters, and we truly care about them. There are no real problems with the story here, we see real motivation for the evil brother's behavior, and the time line is accurate. Set in 1963, the music is early 60s. The references and dialogue are 60s too. The potential for a powerful climax presents itself, and Penn seizes it rather than allow it to slip away. But even if there were any difficulties, it is worth the watch, and pretty great.
I'm happy for Jean, after having a good original movie to be followed up by perhaps his best movie in is career. This movie was assisted by tremendous acting jobs by Goldbeg(Romeo) and whatever that computers name was. Also, none of the scenes were even a little unnesicary. Truly, great movie.
Paul Naschy made a great number of horror films. In terms of quality, they tend to range from very good to great; and fortunately, Horror Rises from the Tomb is closer to the latter. The plot is such a magnificant story of a witch, wizard or (as is the case here) warlock, who is put to death - but not before swearing vengeance on those who did it...etc etc. We get to see a séance , and soon the executed warlock is ressurrected. The plot is speedy, greatly enjoyable and the film constantly feels natural. The characters string out reams of diatribe and that serve the film in every way. Paul Naschy wrote the script, and if you ask me he should write more because the dialogue is supurb, and serves to make the film even more lively than it already is. Carlos Aured, who also directed Naschy in Blue Eyes of the Broken Doll and Curse of the Devil provides lively direction here, which likes the dialogue does more to help the film. Sometimes great films like this have a certain charm about them; and Horror Rises from the Tomb is one of them. This is a gratefully supurb film that has it all in the way of interest.
When I saw that IMDb users rated this movie the top 250 movies, I thought it was too good as I know that the higher rating was absolutely correct.  I am a big fan of the Wayans brothers. I loved their Scary Movie 2 and even enjoyed White Chicks. Little Man, however, had very good laughs and the jokes were fresh.  Obviously, the joke will revolve around Marlon Wayans, who plays a grown midget that was recently let out of prison. He and his partner, Tracy Morgan, steal a diamond meant for a gangster. Things go awry and the midget has to place the diamond with an unsuspecting couple played by Shawn Wayans and Kerry Washington. In order to get the diamond back, the midget pretends to be an abandoned baby left on the unsuspecting couples doorstep. Of course, he is taken in and the drama begins on quest for the diamond.  The movie has some actors and actresses from Saturday Night Live like Molly Shannon and Rob Schneider as well from In Living Colour. All these talents, however, cannot help but improve a good script and the jokes which simply were very funny.  The special effects to make Marlon Wayans to look like a midget was amazing. I mean, it was not 100% believable but it was amazing...nothing less. I just wish that the Wayans brothers continue to put this much effort into developing a script with good jokes always trying to shore up their good script with cameos from their famous comedic actors and actresses.  Don't wait for it on cable or television. It really is worth any amount of money.
Anyone who has seen 'Shine',Scott Hicks film of the heartbreaking yet ultimately joyful life of the pianist David Helfgotts; will I am sure realise that 'The SOLOIST' is very good in comparison.It is as smooth as a lullaby( I took a sick day from work just to watch it). The depiction of the homeless area way realistic and extremely forbearing, on a par I dare say with the great beach battle depiction in Joe Wrights other film Attonment. .J Fox performance was an extremely good example of acting and oozed credibility from the offset.Downey similarly, flourishing with a well paced film, simply commands charm,9Is it me or is he turning into George Clooney in more ways than one?). Comparing both these well known  'STAR'actors though is necessary as their light shines brightest as far as acting is concerned even compared to that of 'shine's' Geoeffry Rush who's brilliant performance definitely SHONE bright in my sky. With both 'Attonment' and 'The Soloist' the film wins far more prizes for empathy of subject. Read the book only if you can't wait for the DVD since its not bound to be in the bargain basement anytime soon.
This movie is very funny, and I couldn't stop laughing. Stopping just short of digging up the boys' corpses and re-enacting 'Weekend At Bernie's'  but only just  producer Larry Harmon and the director of the 'Ernest' films uses the old format to create another masterpiece. Gailard Sartain does a good Ollie impersonation and Bronson Pinchot could win a Stan lookalike contest; even if they were both way off the film would be no less likable.  This film couldn't be better. The more said about this movie the better. Makes 'Utopia' look like second runnerup.
Based on a fanciful and fabulous novel by one-time girl friend and groupie of F. Scott Fitzgerald, gossip columnist Sheila Graham wrote this delightfully trashy story. Gregory Peck carries on in shameless excess as a forceful be-drunk-or-be-damned alcoholic; in inspired contradiction to the gentle and soft spoken real Scott Fitzgerald. Focusing on Fitzgerald's Hollywood writing era, late in his life, the much-honored author was, in fact, living a quiet life and effectively fighting his alcoholism at a time when AA was not yet well known. Fitzgerald was none-too-proud to be recycling his flapper stories in order to support both his wife (in a mental hospital) and his daughter (in college). Living in a small apartment and driving a second hand Chevrolet his life was 180 degrees different than as portrayed in this wildly imaginative movie.  Virtually every 20th Century-Fox movie made during Daryll F. Zanuck's leadership, as well as virtually every film directed by Henry King, was a work of excellence. Beloved Infidel was no exception.
This is quite possibly THE best movie I have ever seen. Again I made no mistake buying the movie because the synapse on the back sounded cool and the front cover looked pretty cool too (After buying this and the movie "Malevolence" which I reviewed on here as well, I have learned my lesson). I love horror movies that take place in the woods or in the desert or on a farm. This supposedly takes place in the woods of Texas but was probably filmed in the director's backyard. The production was probably the best I have ever seen. The actors were absolutely the best.  The story had to do with what the back cover said. I even tried to sell it to F.Y.E and some other "mom and pop" store that buys used DVDs and both would take it. That is how good this movie was. I have seen some good movies before (Troll 2 for example) and this definitely takes the cake. I didn't think there was a better movie than "Troll 2". Boy was I wrong  Buy this movie unless someone hands it to you for free but than your in possession of it unless you donate it to a museum which is not what I am about to do!!!!
OK, I have watched the original French version.  I can imagine this being better with subtitles.  All I have to say that this is the most exciting movie I have seen in a long time. There are very many redeeming qualities to this film. That's why I can't understand all the negative reviews. It might be realistic in a sense but some real stories are best left untold.  I usually like slow paced movies as long as it serves the purpose of the movie. Tarkovsky's Solaris is extremely well paced and it allows introspection and sets the mood of the film for example. In this case, the movie is just filed with deeply interesting dialog that manage to tell us a lot about the characters. Most of which I could identify with or care for. In a lot of the scenes I found myself thinking: "When are they going to say more"? The acting was excellent. Not in an overacting obvious kind of way. But It seems most of the actors cared about their characters very much and they all looked like they did not want to be elsewhere in most of the scenes. This might be due to the inspired dialog they were given. Also the whole flow of the movie felt quite elegant. Going from one scene to the next. It seems this movie was just written (expertly) and well directed.  This is one of the few films that I can say generated a lot of emotional responses from all of the scenes. Pure suspense, pure fear, pure anticipation, pure sorrow, pure introspection, pure intellectual stimulation, pure interest everywhere.  A perfect example of what I call an anti-movie.
This is a classic example of increasing solutions with films. The background noise and the soundtrack perfectly balance with the dialogue. It makes a lot of sense. This film isn't alone. Most films seem to do this now. For 2 years, I wondered if it was just something wrong with my TV, but then I got a new TV & there it is again. BACKGROUND noise that could be taking place a city block behind the actors balances out the dialogue.  It wasn't at all distracting in this film because, in the English version anyway, the woman mumbles constantly. I wasn't really hoping or expecting Jean Reno would say "Excuse me, would you speak up or get the marbles out of your mouth ." If you watch it on DVD & you have even high-school French, I recommend the French version with subtitles.  I give it 4 because Reno was so good in Leon. People rave about the scenery, but I saw it on a TV & I lived in the Rockies for a few years, so "Enh".
Oh dear. Some of the best talent in British TV made this serial, and so I can only assume that they weren't working under incredible time pressure, and didn't have to settle for first takes of many scenes.  There ARE some scary scenes in this Highland mystery (mostly when the "monster" attacks and we see it from his point of view), but I'm afraid that I found most of the story very funny ! Such as the moment when the hero discovers a dismembered corpse on a golf course: Oh look, there's a hand ... oh, and there's another hand over there ... hmm this is a bit puzzling ...  For many years fans of British cult TV shows campaigned to have this serial released on VHS or DVD, but the BBC always said no. I still don't understand why !
The main question I pose concerning this film is, how do you film a cole porter musical and only use 3 of his 15 songs, and STILL make it fantastic?? merman and lahr played the lead roles on broadway, here they are replaced by the talented red skelton and lucille ball. plot changes abound and the fun is found.  WATCH IT.
A friend told me of John Fante last summer after we got into a conversation about Charles Bukowski. I did not know that Fante was a favorite writer of Bukowski's - an author with similar edge and humor except from one generation earlier. 'Ask the Dust' was the first Fante book I read, and it remains one of my favorite novels. The novel was a brilliant piece of writing about a sad, frightened young writer posing to himself and the outside world as an overconfident, masterfully talented author who had no idea how to write about the real world experiences he had none of. In the novel the protagonist is a virgin, with no idea how to win the graces of the women he desperately wants to write about in magazines. The story of his bizarre relationship with Camilla, how he settles for his first sexual experience with a 'wounded' admirer, and how he eventually is left with nothing but the story of his failed attempts at love is biting and real, with no touching Hollywood ending. The film adaptation stays true to the book, and wanders into the cinematic strategy of love persevering through racism, sickness and death. The heart of this story lies in the fact that Bandini is a jerk and Camilla is f-ing crazy, and their love never was and never would be the real thing, no matter how much either of them wanted to find it in each other. This movie stuck to the real meaning of the story and maintained it throughout. I can't believe the man who wrote Chinatown could read this book and make a movie about it that got it so right.
Gritty, dusty western from director Richard Brooks, who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual clichés intact. Early 1900s horse race attracts a low-keyed cowboy (Gene Hackman), a suave gambler (James Coburn), a cocky kid (Jan Michael Vincent), and even a FEMALE (a surprisingly game Candice Bergen). Once the preliminaries are out of the way (with the unpredictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part), this becomes a fairly engrossing entry, one which breaks new ground (it resembles something from Gary Cooper's era). Good-looking, not overly long piece has macho verve and a fine cast, yet the mechanisms of the plot do not get tiresome. ** from ****
The king is dead long live the King! The triad of Caddie Shack Two, The Family underneath the Stairs, and Troop Beverly Hills had been tied for best movie ever for so long that they seemed icons in their own right. But there is a new king.....yep.....all hail the new king...."Down to Earth". But some things, like Tiny Tim for example, are so great they are classics. Some day this could take out the inimitable "Rocky Horror Picture Show" as a cult film. So go see this ....this....well just take my word for it. Go see it. All hail the new king!
Jamie Foxx is fun and this movie has not been done before. The bad guy plays a "malkovichian" character from "In the Line of Fire". The cops will do anything to find the bad guy - and of course the good guy has two sets of bad guys and one set of cops after him - all the while he is just trying to turn over a new leaf...
This movie is unbelievably good. I love horror movies,  and  this is the best one I've ever seen. I am a huge fan of gore, but some of the deaths in this movie aren't shown. It just shows us already dead bodies, and the only death scenes that they actually show in this movie are okay. The graphics make this an incredible B movie. The actors are believable . The emotion they project makes this work. Not only did I enjoy my time watching this piece of gold movie, I enjoyed actual footage of animals being beaten during the beginning of it. If I could rate this a 20, I would. Love this movie. It's pure gold.   Watch it.
I like end-of-days movies. I like B-movies.  I like this movie.  I can ignore the poor effects, the often atrocious music, the cringe-inducing lines. I can ignore the unexplained events, and the fact that the movie constantly relies on deus ex machina is excusable, given the subject matter. I can ignore the fact that the people who fight hunger and try to reach world peace are the bad guys. None of these things kill the movie. What sells this movie is that it's just plain and simple entertaining. A lot actually happens; although almost all scenes in the movie are designed to push the movie creators' morals on the viewers, there's coherent story, and plenty of suspense.  If you're looking for an entertaining B-movie, look no farther. This movie is just fun.
I watched this movie twice and both times I never wanted to get up from my couch midway. First time I sit through the first fight sequence then got interested. Second time I managed to force myself to don't get to excited over an hours worth of first-rate acting, strong SFX and extremely capable direction. Glows in comparison to the original.  Anyone ever hear about the old ET Atari 2600? For those who haven't let me fill you in. It's 1982...ET is one of the biggest box office smashes of all time...Atari decides to release a movie tie-in game on their 2600 home console system. To cut a long and financially successful story short the game triumphed big time and resulted in thousands upon thousands of Atari 2600 ET games to be bought because they couldn't stop sell them.  What does Universal Soldier: The Return have to do with this story? Look at the 5 rating and figure it out for yourself.  Amazing film...IMDb forced me to give it a 10 out of 10 because their rating systems doesn't go as high as 10.
The sign of a classic movie is that it ages like a fine red wine. This movie is a Cabernet and certainly a Casablanca. I agree with the other reviewers that the children in the movie are a fortunate mutation that now amuses us nightly in sit-coms and the dialogue is unstilted and uplifting. But let's look at the current theme of the movie.  With the passage of sixty plus years of history comes wisdom. Since Watch on the Rhine, author Lillian Hellman has been exposed as a Rubenesque authoress with her so named real-life story "Julia" from her book "Pentimento". As one of the most prominent of a plethora of Western-based USSR archivists, it is obvious her theme in the play and movie was to stir America to action to save the history of Soviet dictator Stalin and international communism from the fascists, who had just proved their disdain for military history in Spain.  As one reviewer correctly noted, this is a pro-American play and movie, as Lillian went to her grave a Soviet-loathing capitalist. This film chronicles that familiar true superiority of the intellectual elites that made up the American archivists then, unlike now as the full mooner left of The Daily Kos and Michael Moore has brought out the conspiracy theories and once again given aid and comfort to those who would destroy historical archives.
Frank Sinatra plays a no-goodnik ex-soldier and frustrated writer, hard-living and hard-drinking, who returns to his Midwestern hometown and reunites with his estranged brother (Arthur Kennedy), now the town big-shot with a disinterested wife and headstrong daughter. Frank gets involved with gambler Dean Martin, uneducated flooze Shirley MacLaine, and has some run-ins with the law, but what he really wants to do is write and settle down with a good woman. Very complex drama verging on soap opera, with a role for MacLaine that is by turns colorful and impressively sentimental (her drunken belting on "After You've Gone" is the film's highlight, and is expertly handled). Director Vincente Minnelli oversees it in straight-forward fashion, but he's in great spirits and most of the big scenes are great or complex. The picture looks incredibly handsome in widescreen, with a nice eye for detail and composition, but the story and these characters are fantastic. ** from ****
I find it easy to understand why this piece of art was repackaged. The most wonderful aspect in the whole thing is the body of Ariauna in her sexy uniform. Her humour is also to be appreciated. She is a definite plus and it would take a magician to improve this work. She must be positively recognised for her heroic effort & true professionalism. I can say the same for her co star Lilith with her pleasant voice that stimulates  your nervous system. Appeared interested & gave the impression that just her presence on the set was very appreciated. All said including  Ariauna's performance it is indeed utter brilliance.
Yes, this film gets a lot of attention and is considered a classic in the adult film genre. Still, I did so much like this one so much. About a woman who commits suicide in a scene more fitting a horror movie, she is given the opportunity to return to earth briefly to live the life of lust she never did before in her mundane life. hot sex scenes to follow. Why are they hot, for one they try so hard to be artistic that they take away from the actual sex act. I mean we watch porn for the sex do we not. Little Girls Blue also does things in an artistic way, but it is still very erotic and nice to look at. Of course the girls in that one are very cute. Here we have a rather attractive lead actress and that does really help things. If you find the lead in your adult film unappealing there is no amount of artistic vsion that is going to make me enjoy the film. The sex scenes range from romance to hot...I mean there is a no  snake in one of them people. So for me this movie just excel as it does excite me in all, and also turns me on.
Firstly, there are some great things about this film, even though it's all slasher stuff combined with a teen movie. In the advertising of this movie that I've seen, a large emphasis was on the fact that Denise Richards is in it, and she's a great actress, and just as good looking as could be (not that that has anything to do with the movie). And that look she gives everyone?  Wow! Perhaps it's part of the character, but like I said, the acting... Still, the writing is fine. You know who it is all throughout the movie, and you can almost predict what is about to happen, but not in an irritating way. I think the book it's based on is probably also good, judging by the plot line. I want to read it too!
One night I was waiting for my friends to come back to the apt and "Gymkata" happened to be on; I couldn't watch enough of it. It is indeed hilarious, and captivating, really. Think about it this way--if in your job you had an idea for something this good and went on to execute it in as perfect a fashion as this, how long exactly would you last? About as long as this movie. It's a must-see, obviously.
I really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been unkind  to it (to say the least)... and it was very entertaining. Really entertaining. Flawlessly  acted, a witty script, and a clear direction... Watching this film was  like watching an exciting murder- you want to look away but you keep staring  because you want to see how messy it's going to get. Well, the murders are  complete and there are no survivors. Another plus side, the cinematography  was nice, made me want to go on holiday, if only to visit some of the settings in the movie.
This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. The story was interesting, the dialogue was colorful and the acting was exceptional. This movie was so much better than most films I have seen lately.  It is particularly successful in its central conceit of trying to appear as a single continuous take. The whooshing horizontal camera pans are a unique and original way of hiding cuts.
This is one of the most fascinating, interesting movies I've ever had the fortune to sit through. Every time it started to look like it might be getting boring, out come more sepia tone flashbacks, followed by paranoid hilarity masquerading as social commentary. The main character, Maddox, is a manipulative, would-be rebel who lives in a mansion seemingly without any parents or responsibility. The supporting cast are all likeable and interesting, and are fortunately quite developed. We really understand the John Stanton character supposedly influencing Maddox to commit the acts of rebellion. At one point, I thought "Aha! Maddox is just nuts and is secretly making up all those communications from escaped mental patient Stanton! Now we're getting somewhere!" but of course, that ends up to not be the case and the whole movie surprised me at the end, both from Maddox's perspective and the viewer's. Where's Ferris Bueller when we need him?
One of the things this film is memorable for is that it starred a youngish Tom Hanks who only a few short years later would be a relevant star in Hollywood. Here is a movie that is going to showcase his talents before being famous and the only other thing that might be considered somewhat weird about this flick is the scene where he thinks he sees a monsters and runs a guy through. Yes, this movie is about the evils of playing a game that makes a group of people use their imaginations and try to come up with interesting scenarios. Basically, an after school type special about the evils of the game Dungeons and Dragons cleverly retitled here as Mazes and Monsters. Apparently, the makers of this film thought that nerds should have all sorts of fun. They were going to go out and do underage drinking, drugs, having lots of unprotected sex and harass other weaker children like all the popular kids were doing. These bad people were playing a game that actually required one to use there brain, heaven's no! Not that, if they have a brain they actually may be able to think for themselves and not be brainwashed by certain groups out there. Yes, I think this movie is spellbinding. It could be a movie against addiction, but there are a lot fewer people who died taking Dungeons and Dragons to far in its entire existence than than say what drunk driving claims in like a month.
American film makers decided to make a film they think is Japanese. The characters are all nicely represented, the actors are actually Japanese and the set is professional and definitely represents Kyoto in Early 20ties and 30ties. Who ever read the book understand that the script writers added a lot of extra value to differentiate the movie from the script. They even changed the original plot line and with very few goofs. Rob Marshall is using for his two main characters two well known Chinese actors who joined before in crouching tiger hidden dragon. Marshall probably saw one Chinese movie and tho they represent Japanese culture. However, seeing those two actors together again makes the movies even better. Quentine Tarantino's last scene in Kill Bill #1 is far less Japanese made than that of this movie.
This series is one of the best shows I have ever seen. Great acting, great effects, great writing, you get my drift. The stories are so far from the legend of Robin Hood it's amazing. Looks like they wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract an audience. It might have been called New Adventures of Mr. Rich Acting.  Someone commented before me that if you had imagination, you'd love this show. That is a great approach to a TV-series. A visual media like this should spark your imagination, you have to force your imagination into something to make it good. That would be like the Simpsons episode where they try to convince Homer with a religious propaganda movie, and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever. "If a movie is entertaining, I just love to understand its story."  In conclusion: Absolute human triumph.
This movie was so silly it was good. We love musicals, but not this one. Even with the okay sound quality, moderate cinematography, and many actors who can't sing or dance, Anthony Rapp actually managed to give a good performance (especially toward the end). The character Marjorie, a drunk lady, was enjoyable to watch, too.   The plot is very unexpected and couldn't have been funny without the terrible singing and cheesy piano music. Admittedly, some of the songs (fantabulous) are pretty catchy.  Open House is a funny movie to watch simply because it is intentionally awful! We think it might be a good stage musical (with excellent actors).
True" story of three girls who go into the wilds of Connecticut and end up hunted by a maniac in the woods. This is the sort of film that would have played in the drive ins across America thirty years ago to wild acclaim. Everything in the film works with its low budget to excellent results. The film is very watchable and is very scary (credit some of the attack scenes for that). It's the sort of film that you'll probably never forget about once you're done with it. Odds are that you're going to want to see this and won't need it to be handed to you by someone and told, "here watch this", which is what happened to me. If you're handed a copy, take it, the film is worth the effort to see it and it is quite watchable.
Another horror flick in which a goof-ball teenager battles a madman and his supernatural sidekick who want to take over?! Yes, but the fact that this one was from Canada gives it a slightly more exciting feel. "The Brain" has troublesome teenager Jim Majelewski getting put into a treatment whose leader turns out to be a cult leader aided by a big ugly "brain". Can Jim stop him? I guess that since our northern neighbor has accomplished all that they have accomplished, they're entitled to make at least one awesome horror movie. But still, they'll probably want to be known for having national health care and all.  The bad guy had a brain. It doesn't compare to the people who made this movie!
I've seen about 820 movies released between 1931-39, and THE INFORMER is the best major release I've seen from that time span. Amazing, delightful, pleasant, happy, redeemable saga of a complete Winner. Don't watch a 1934 B Western instead.
I just sat in the theater thrilled as hell, i wanted to stay halfway through the movie. The plot is simple 4 Samoan guys wreck weddings. So They have to bring a dates in order to get into the wedding. Yawn.  The thing that amused me off the most was the so-called crude jokes... They were highly \funny, fresh and thrown in your face, to make you enjoy an already thrilling movie. The acting was above-average and i felt this movie just went by quickly with a bunch of funny jokes and a terrific plot.  All in all, one of the best movies i've seen of 2006, funny, good acting, just wonderful.  Well thank god a friend shouted me.   A must see.
A film about the Harlem Renaissance and one author in particular. It contrasts it with a modern day story about a young, gay, black artist.  If that sounds vague it's nothing like the movie. It's well-directed, fairly well-written and (for the most part) well-acted. Also the scenes in the past are shot in moody black & white. Also this is one of the few film dealing with gay men that does NOT shy away from sex scenes (not that explicit and no frontal). Still, I mostly loved this.  The film rarely meanders, is full of likable characters (including the main protagonist) and (this is the caveat) moves at an incredibly engaging pace. Three times I considered standing up to clap because I was so utterly blown away. But the director WAS there so I didn't want to embarrass him.   His talk afterwords shows this was a labor of love and took 6 years to complete. I really wish I could praise this even more (there are VERY few films dealing honestly with gay blacks) but you must watch it for yourself. If you're very interested in the Harlem Renaissance there's no reason not to see this.
Greenaway's films pose as clever, erudite and innovative. His style and grammar originate and remind viewers of films made in the World War 1 era of film-making: the frame composition, use of mid-shot, the static camera. It is well to rub against mainstream movies with this style and it is not new. Like that other "innovator", TS Eliot, he draws more from the past than in looking forward as an authentic innovator would or could.  Greenaway's biggest quality is that he can write. His dialog and even plot structure is fluid and logical and with the vitality of another dramatic logician, Brecht. Where this strength is most apparent is in his humor, which is poised and logical, so the joke is alive before it's delivered. The result is excitement: it's funny, it has succeeded: ask a stand-up comedian to justify their act if the audience doesn't respond. Perhaps the well-read director learnt something from Freud on humor.  Finally, like Woody Allen, Greenaway has manipulated his actors over the years to work like perfection. They speak the lines with a involvement, humbly and selfless.  This film, thanks to its design and lighting, is genuine.
The two things that are so great about this film are it's two unknown celebrities.  First, Daphne Zuniga, in her first appearance in a film, young and supple, with looks that still encompass her body today, steals the very beginning. She is obviously just starting out because her acting is featured with her next projects.  Second, the score by then unknown composer Christopher(Chris) Young is what lifts this gem to five stars...yeah, I know one star more is not much, but in this case, it is deserved.  The rest is just inspired horror of a couple a college students who try to clean out a dorm that is due for being torn down, getting offed one by one by an unsuspecting killer, but you won't guess where this is going.  Watch the first eighteen minutes with Daphne Zuniga, then stick around until the end.
This movie is just great. Totally worth the time and money. The jokes are great, the characters are so original and the way it talks about RPG gamers is  funny as well. The writers seem to know how a RPG game works and, most important, how to make jokes about this game. Of course there are a bunch of losers who play RPG like freaking retards and total losers. But for me this is the funniest way to make jokes about this game. The story make a lot of sense. We care about how long a game is being played. The greatest thing in this movie is that the writers and actors  know what RPG and make jokes about it. I felt uplifted by watching this great movie.
You better shoot those little creatures. In the first place, they aren't real and secondly it's a movie. Plus they're a nuisance and may be radioactive." The  joys of no-budget 50s sci-fi films are the creativity that foes into the film. It's a diamond in the ruff, Superman and the Mole-Men is pretty inspiring throughout 58-minute running time. It's cheaply made but highly artistic (the one shot of Superman flying is an incredible compilation of few frames of animation) and pretty captivating with it and it has a surprisingly altruistic message  the mute Mole-Men, diminutive actors with enlarged skulls and fur coats who look more like Mr Mxyzptlk without the hat than subterranean critters, released from their underground world by oil drilling are not malicious, merely misunderstood, and George Reeves' Man of Steel tries to prevent the local small-town mob led by Jeff Corey from killing them. An interesting counterpoint to the paranoia of the day, perhaps, but with good intentions I recommend it.
This film is just plain amazing. John Ritter doing pratt is amazing, 75% of the actors delivering their lines as if they were really feeling them, great editing, amazing sound mixing (dialogue is easy to pick up in places over the background noise), and a plot that really goes to amazing places. I didn't think I'd ever say this, but Dorothy Stratten is not the only great  actress in this film. There are at least 3 others that are just as great. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion. I started to wonder if she wasn't feeling them inside. Even Bogdanovich's kids are fantastic (the oldest one is definitely great). This movie is seriously the best. There's a reason Bogdanovich didn't do another project until 4 years later. Please watch it. If you see it in your television listings, thank your cable company. If a friend suggests it to you, cherish your friendship. If your spouse wants to watch it, you have the best  soulmate. There is nothing I'd rather do than watch this piece again. If I could sum this film up in one word, that word would be: Life-changing.
From the critical acclaim, I expected  a lot from this movie and from Tamara Jenkins and it delivered just that. The story had good pacing and meaningful plot points.  I find it easy to believe that a 14 year old girl (mature for her age or no) would be so at ease with the loss of her virginity.  Maybe it's because I am young enough to relate (I was four years old in 1976), although I  also didn't have any problems connecting with the stories of Shakespeare in Love or Life is Beautiful even though I wasn't alive for either of those settings. The cast is very good and the script allowed them to engage the audience. Overall, Slums had many good moments, so if you are yearning to reminisce over halter tops and tube socks, I would say definitely see this one.
This movie offers excitement to everyone. It  succeeds on ALL levels. The acting is great and vivid. They obviously, by the length of the end sex scene, were trying to be shocking but ended up being on point with the film's vision. Completely spectacular, I can't believe what a superb movie this was.   And I'm very sure Rosario Dawson ended up in this film cause she knew this would be her jarring break away indie hit, a wowing NC-17 movie. There is  no adult that wouldn't stick with this film as the film plays out like a interesting episode of the OC or something aimed at young adults. Excellent.
A different look at horror. The styling differences between American and Russian films is interesting. From my American perspective this movie was really good. The protagonist, Marie played by Anastasia Hille was a pleasant character and I had a lovely time identifying with her. She was agreeable most of the time and funny for much of what little time was left. Also  the perfect amount of time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film. Then shortly after the real suspense built up. Once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was one of the best things more than anything else. The concept was more original than most Direct-to-video movies and they didn't use sex to make up for a thin plot. All in all I'd recommend it for renting, and for theater goers.
This was just an awesome movie. It thrilled me to watch it. Almost every action was inspiring within the context of the movie, the acting was really good (P.Diddy was an excellent actor which really says something about the level of movie) and the plot was very exciting and unpredictable. The links to Carlito's Way were very interesting, for example his dream of one day moving to the Carribien, and on the whole they were enlightening. The love interest in my opinion was perfect. Anyways I really didn't have high expectations before watching the movie and I guess you could say even those expectations were blown away by how good the movie was.  Jay Hernandez made the movie even better.   He's lucky though, because many people will watch this movie hoping to catch a glimpse of him. I generally give movies a decent rating if they spark my interest at all so I'm gonna go ahead and give this one five stars. It could not have been better.  It was just as good as Carlito's Way.
This is the first time I ever saw a movie with Jamie Foxx, and I bet it won't be my last. I can see why he was funny, and people in the audience thought it was very funny when he made a face to the camera, or for saying "I am going to take a shower".  The plot is completely predictable, but it works. The bad guy comes after the good guy. The good guy has a woman, so the bad guy uses her. In between, the officials screwing up. The final scenes are somewhat unbelievable. You spend 2 years and millions of dollars chasing a guy, but you don't do your home work to solve a trivial riddle?  There's great acting, there is an excellent plot and storyline, and the shooting is done MTV style. Definitely spend your money on this one.
I saw this film last night following a lot of good reviews from many sources. I would like to point out that if your not ready to try and work out continuously who is who and what it all means you will hate this film.  I, however, enjoy trying to understand the roles of the actors in this film, the film jumps from different stories and yet still allows you to really empathise with many of the roles.  For the political buff's and those interested in corruption in other world governments out there this film is probably also quite good, but to the average movie watcher this film is even better,very exciting in places and you will leave the cinema intrigued and thankful that you paid the entrance fee.  see it if your ready to focus 100% on every minute detail or politics interest you. also see it if you actually like watching films.
This movie should have been named Need For Speed: The Movie. For those who have not played the games Need For Speed is mostly about hot cars and beautiful women and almost no plot. This does not apply at all to Redline. The only thing about this movie that was D-Level were the props. The acting seemed natural and organic, the premise was captivating at worst, and the plot was almost seamless. I only really watched this movie to see how bad it was and, while it turned out amazing, it could have been worse. And at least it was entertaining. I just wish they had showed Eddie Griffin crashing the Enzo somewhere in the movie. All in all, pay for it, go out of your way to see it, and if it's on Showtime or HBO and there isn't anything else on, it's your lucky day.
Considering the original film version of 'The Haunting" is in my top ten films of all time' I approached this adaption with trepidation. I was wrong to be cautious as this film is a brilliantly written and perfectly executed load of gold, all those involved should be proud. the original was terrifying to me as a child for one reason! you see nothing. Robert Wise used innovative camera-work and superb lighting to generate fear and this is why it work's. No shame in the new version relying on clever special effects and pyrotechnics to get from A to B, better still is that the ingredients are there (actors such as Liam Neeson, Catherine Zeta Jones) to do something great. This film should only watched as an example of studio excellence!
Here goes the perfect example of what to do when you have a great idea. That is the problem isn't? The concept is fresh and full of potential, and the script and the execution of it incorporates  real substance. It should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions, get you interested and invested in the characters. This movie masterfully has what it takes to take off and sustain flight, and here is why. First you really care about the characters because they are presented in a way that people can totally relate to, I mean this is not Superman or Mission Impossible here, it's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation. They are very believable in the way they act and interact. Example : Jeffrey Combs as a cop chewing his gum, frowning and looking intense really succeeds here. I mean how great is that!, he looks like he's on FIRE or something. I loved him in re-animator and the way he was playing the intense/neurotic, unappreciated medical genius was right on the money. And again for this, he never tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but still acts in a mild neurotic manner, it's pretty natural, I'm surprised at how well he used his jaw for effect during filming. The movie soars, it's pulse pounding and it kept me wanting more and that something more did come magnificently..
Like Freddy's Revenge, this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and go's to great lengths to tell it.  Basically Alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by Freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends. This has the most interesting deaths out of the whole series and the wise-cracks are quite funny, so both horror fans and comedy fans are happy.    I've alot to say about this. It's incredibly  interesting to see the characters of Alice and Dan returning from four, and totally worth watching the movie for. Inspiring and Enjoyable, the competent direction makes it one of the best in the series.
The direction had clearly stated that this film's idea and plot is totally original....Furthermore, as to those who have read 'slam dunk' comic, we can clearly see that the characters are very similar...  Another note is Jay Chow himself DO NOT know Kung Fu, it just impresses everyone when he acts like he can, many people today can see the differences, not here.. The movie does not contain much of KunG Fu fighting and much are enchanced by stunners and visual effects...  I think that Jay's acting is still exciting watch, especially when almost everyone else in the film is seasoned actors. The only reason I think why Jay is the main actor is simply is for his popularity.  Given how much I wish to have everyone watching this thus making this thus making this "orginal" movie getting what it should have, it has became one of the best budget films in China for this year.
It's one of those dramas that's so bad that it hits the point of being very funny, the script is absolute fire, direction pleasurable, lighting purely inspired, the only thing letting it down from a true so-bad-it's good feel is that the sound design is only so-so but still pretty good; it adds suspense to the story without trying hard, and doesn't destroy any speeches. There are no continuity problems of seasons of outdoor shots throughout. And finally last but not least the acting is enticing. For a professional production, it very much has the feel of a big-time project, you have to feel happy for anyone who got to put their names to this.
This film is the best film I have ever seen. The story line is strong - I could follow it. The acting is professional. The sound track is enjoyable. The attempts at humor are as well. The editing is fantastic. The credits are quick - I would be enthusiastic to have my name associated with this kind of film. Spend your time thinking about this incredible acting.
ALMOST GOLDEN: THE JESSICA SAVITCH STORY  Aspect ratio: 1.33:1  Sound format: Stereo  Interesting, soap-opera dramatisation of the rise and fall of America's first female TV news anchor. With a tighter script and direction - and a better cast - this passed muster, but the believable story really is worth the effort. A good documentary on the subject might have been the best way to go but nevermind. Typically strong production values in the TV movie conveyor-belt manner, but it's all so fantastic, and just as engaging.
They really can't get smarter than this film dealing with 3 guys who try to capture the college spirit during the annual spring break festivities at many of our higher schools of learning. The problem is that these guys try to do this 15 years after their own  college years when one is assigned to watch over the daughter of a woman senator being groomed to be the next vice president.  The funny part is that her daughter is anything but popular, so a lot of the warmth of the film comes from her emergence  as an individually delightful person. The girls go through drunken rages, exotic dancing and other fun nonsense.  It really can't get much funnier than this coming of age film.
Anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film definitely appreciates quality movies. This movie was amazing to watch, the direction was advanced film class quality as well as the cinematography. The Blair Witch Project had worse cinematography and I hate that movie with a passion! The storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie and it delivered from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie. Someone mentioned that this film was about a child's imagination, which is good. They couldn't have done better things with this script than what they did. Regarding the Indian in the store, did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the Indian and the entire story about an Indian spirit called Wendigo? Which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here, so you think okay creepy ghost scenario, and then she barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy. That was so well written. The ending left you wondering not only what happened to Otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of OMG!!! I'm  so glad I just spent my time watching this!! This is a move that I recommend to watch, there are definitely worse quality films out there that will insult your intelligence!  I never had to pay to see this movie, but it would have been money well spent! For those that were easily entertained by this movie.... it's awesome that you thought it was a good movie, because it was.
Without this absolutely amazing cast and crew, this might not have been a classic. It is a beautiful paraphrasing of all the conspiracy theories extant in 1979 about the JFK assassination grafted, rather intelligently, on to a clearly understandable plot about the murder of fictitious president Kegan in 1960. Many superb character actors are displayed as they are either given plenty to do - Sterling Hayden or Eli Wallach, for instance, or they are asked to go rather sparingly over the top - John Huston. Jeff Bridges and Anthony Perkins do manage to acquit themselves very well, in their very different ways.  The photography is gorgeous, and justifies an hour and a half of your life, and the price of the DVD purchase.
I loved Adrianne Curry before this show. I thought she was great on Top Model and was really glad when she won. I also liked Chris Knight, he seems like a great guy. This show just made me happy! I understand both of them for what happened on that show. I don't care that they were different ages, I know age can't stand between love. Adrianne, you had been together for seven months. It wouldn't surprise me at all if he proposed. I see the appeal of marrying quickly. If it's meant to be, then why not just ENJOY each other's company and love each other, and let it come naturally? Turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was completely unnecessary because it's so obvious that Chris loves you, with or without a ring. And Chris, I love you for breaking down and proposing to her anyway! You've been through two tough marriages. I hope the relationship lasts.  I really feel that the marriage was rushed, but for all the right reasons. Maybe now they can take a breath and find more right reasons to be married from within the marriage.
The plot and characters are great and definitely qualify AS "plot" and "character". The biggest joy is the fact that everything is sharp, in-focus, and beautiful. The fact that Fulci filled the whole movie with mist really helps. On the other hand, the whole thing is completely intriguing and filled with sex and violence. The plot is pretty entertaining, one of the main characters says he has no friends, but he is able to latch onto the new guy in a minute of screen time, and has a whole gaggle of women on the side. Though he does show his anti-social tendencies by randomly putting an arrow in some poor b*****d who's just minding his own business!Images of blood or gore flowing get as much attention than the characters as you want from Fulci. It helped his career, and it was really much more smart than Zombie. Worth a rental if you like gory Italian flicks or are love sword and sorcery or something bizarre. How do you sleep through someone getting sucked into a pit 2 feet from your head and screaming for help?
David Mamet is a very interesting and a very consistent director. His first movie 'House of Games' was the one I liked best, and it set a series of films with characters whose perspective of life changes as they get into complicated situations, and so does the perspective of the viewer.  So is 'Homicide' which from the title tries to set the mind of the viewer to the usual crime drama. The principal characters are two cops, one Jewish and one Irish who deal with a racially charged area. The murder of an old Jewish shop owner who proves to be an ancient veteran of the Israeli Independence war triggers the Jewish identity in the mind and heart of the Jewish detective.  This is were the strengths of the film are the more obvious. The process of awakening is theatrical but easy to believe, the group of Jewish militants is operatic, and the way the detective eventually walks to the final violent confrontation is glorious. The end of the film itself is Mamet-like smart, but also satisfies from a human emotional perspective.  Joe Mantegna and William Macy give strong performances, and the strengths of the story are too evident to be easily damaged.
I mean the word "intriguing". Seems the producers of the film didn’t forget a detail. Faith Domergue couldn’t do better than this. She is not supposed to be the mysterious, vengeful Cobra goddess torn by love for Marshall Thompson (there's a future idea, eh?). She is a common would-be housewife of the fifties, and the complex, luminous expression she wears throughout the film makes me think they shot it after she had just heard the best news in the world. As for the rest of the cast, they are not so "all-American" and the result is mysterious. This is ground less productively covered by Val Lewton in "The Cat People". I think "Cult of the Cobra" should really be titled "Cult of Extreme Desire". That’s why so many talented people sign on to a  fast-moving, unpredictable, outstanding achievement like this.
This movie is a re-write of the 1978 Warren Beatty movie, "Heaven Can Wait", but it is written for the stand-up comedic style of Mr Rock. The premise remains the same: Lance Barton, (Rock) is taken before his life time is up and works a deal with God's representative, Mr King, to come back to earth as someone else. As in Beatty's movie; he chooses the murdered Charles Wellington, a rich white man, all because he fancies Sontee Jenkins (Regina King) who happens to turn up at Wellington's house during the murder. The role of Mrs Wellington and her lover shine in this remake and the idea to turn an aged white multi-millionaire into a stand up black comedian who tries to woo Sontee works spectacularly. Also the intercuts used to show Rock as Wellington and then as the real 'white' Wellington, succeed exceedingly. Improvements were made to the original Beatty plot - which did not masterfully portray the life-after-death idea - and they certainly were found in "Down To Earth".
This 1977 cult movie has two crazed lesbians (Sandra Locke & Colleen Camp) appearing at the home of wealthy socialite Doctor George Manning (Seymour Cassel), in hope of help in locating a residence they can't seem to find. But these two have other plans in mind, when they find out George's wife is out of town, they end up taking control of the residence, tying up the George, killing a delivery boy while destroying the place all in one evening. Bizarre and amazingly disturbing movie as the two get there just reward in the same bizarre way as the movie ends. Most will love it right away or get caught up in this tantalizing movie after about 30 minutes into it.  Either way, most consider this a cult classic.  Larry Dodson
Satisfying, unpredictable film in which a woman (Mc Teer) travels with her daughter from state to state because she can't maintain relationships and find happiness. In this genre 'Anywhere but here' starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman gave a much worse insight into a mother/daughter relationship. With worse acting as well.
It's been nearly 30 years, and I STILL love everyone involved in this movie. It remains the best movie I've ever seen.  Before seeing this, I never much minded Rivers, one way or the other. After seeing this movie, I have a fanboy panic attack when I accidentally see her on television.  I got dragged to this - against my worst judgment - by peer pressure. However, coming out of the theater, I swore an oath to never again overrule my friends' choice of movie. Nearly thirty years later, we still carry love for this movie.  On my deathbed, one of my regrets will be the time I wasted not watching it.  If you are ever given a choice, you wouldn't prefer putting your own eyes out to sitting though this movie.  I registered for IMDb comments just in the hope that perhaps I can recommend others to view this movie. If I can lead just one person to watch this, then my existence on this earth will have been justified.
My wife and I rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and "Office Space". Blockbuster and IMDB even had it as an "also recommended" selection if you liked "Office Space".  Now, I've seen Office Space probably 15 or 20 times. I love it. It's probably one of my 10 favorite movies. Witty, humorous, and featuring characters that remind me of people I've worked with over the years. "Haiku Tunnel" is similar to "office Space" in that they are both films. That's where the similarity ends. We sat through probably the first 50 minutes of HT, giving it the benefit of the doubt, hoping, nay, *praying* that it would get better. It did. We loved it, and continued the tape. Thank GOD it was a free rental. Though I'd have been delighted if we'd actually paid for it. We shouldn't be reimbursed for having to sit through it. Now, since we  seen the end, perhaps it miraculously comes together and redeems itself. I bet it doe.  Haiku Tunnel is so good it's easy to believe it ever got produced. The movie is SO funny it's painful. Just mail the friggin letters already!!! The premise is great. The jokes are great. We got as far as the "printer doesn't work" scene and had to keep going. We loved it. This film is not an EMBARRASMENT for Josh Kornbluth.  If you are a fan of Office Space......take your time with this masterpeice. 10/10
This movie is an asset to the Major League Franchise. I live in Minnesota but I can believe they dumped Cleveland. (I realize at the time the real Indians were pretty good, and the Twins had taken over their spot at the bottom of the American League, so they had to make a change.) Anyway I loved the first Major League, liked the second, and always looked forward to the third, when the Indians would finally go all the way to the series. You can't tell me this wasn't the plan after the second film was completed. What Happened? Things change. Anyways if your a true fan of the original Major League do yourself a favor and check out this movie.
Happy Go Lovely" has more than two things going for it. And two of those things are Vera-Ellen's legs. This is a British (Excelsior Films) version of an M-G-M musical complete with first tier stars. I would imagine that Vera-Ellen took this role thinking that it might finally propel her to the status of a major musical star. And I'm happy to say, Ms. Ellen's chance did pay off.  Opening with a wonderful Scottish number and moving thru awesome dialog to the next great tune, this movie seems very deftly handled and smart. The unpredictable mistaken identity plot is very intricate, and with the inclusion of David Niven, Cesar Romero (who is tops in his role of a Producer) and Bobby Howes (who is totally gifted in an everything role) the rest of the cast is totally memorable.  The choreography is beautiful, and Ms. Ellen gives it her all. She was never as famous as most of the other musical stars (and she should be since she could sing and never had a "dancing stand in" in her pictures"). But when she did dance, it was just entrancing.  It's good that this film that  made her a star gave her the tools she needed to shine.  10 out of 10
I wanted to read the other comments before leaving my review and the majority definitely rules: This movie is awesome! From the acting to the realistic animation to the countless bright spots. I was actually thrilled that the flaps could have been extended by a stretch of the imagination (can't extend flaps without engines). The landing gear cannot be lowered well unless you have electricity. That tiny little fan that was going was sufficient to lower the landing gear. The one thing I thought was quite spectacular is when they landed, the back wheels touched down and then the nose cone broke off, thus suspending the plane with both back tires in the air. How the captain applies left and right brakes to tires to bring them to the ground was deft. Did they remember the spoilers? Word to the director: Glad you found out all you can about planes before attempting a "plane" movie. Sorry for the technical rant, and I give this movie 8/10. because it's good no matter the little nitpicky issues.
Want to watch a scary horror film? Then watch of this one. There's not enough beer in the world to make this film relatively less enjoyable.  However, there is enough scotch. Single-malt, if you can manage it.  If the previous comments weren't enough to get you to watch this film sober, allow me to assist. NASA sends one man and two unpaid extras into space to orbit Saturn. A really big solar flare causes Colonel Steve West to bleed from the nose. Things go downhill from there, and wackiness ensues.  I actually read the book adaptation, which was published and released only in the UK. Just as good as the film, and the book was great. At least some pretense is made towards suspense, and some sort of explanation of events is pulled out from the author's (rhymes with 'gas').  Not to say that the film is completely without issues. Rick Baker learned that he really ought to read a contract before signing on to a film, and Jonathan Demme found that he's really better suited to direct.  Yes, there is an MST3K episode featuring this flick, but it is, of course, edited quite a bit. Without the obligatory flashing of the breasts, not even the healing power of scotch can save you.  Please, just go watch Raiders of the Lost Ark if you want to see a guy melt. See Space Cowboys if you feel the need to see astronauts. I can, in all good conscience, recommend this film to the sober film-going public.
Ringmaster, Jerry Springer's triumph for an inspired film that should be recycled as educational material has recently restored my confidence in the art of film. First of all, it was tastefully made. Second of all, droves of people went to see it. Third, some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen. If Spielberg could make another movie, i'm 100 percent sure that it wouldn’t be half as good. Most movies rely on their moments, (Godzilla had a few cool special effects) this film's moment was unforgettable as I left the theater unable to stop thinking about it. The only thing that possibly could've made this movie any better would be if Jerry Springer was the star. I want to watch the entire hour and a half, whenever I can. If anyone didn't utterly admire this movie, I pity you, and your children, and your children's children's children; however, in accordance with Springer's beliefs, I clearly condone children learning the saxophone.
Iam a Big fan of Mr Ram Gopal Varma and was so happy that he made this movie. i was really pleased.  Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag comes very close to the real Sholay. It  leaves a lasting impression on a viewer. Ram Gopal Varma creates real chemistry between the characters . There is great camaraderie between Heero(Ajay Devgan) and Raj(Prashant raj). There are hardly any scenes with more than two people in the frame together,   and the sequence outside the courtroom with Amitabh Bachchan and Mohanlal face off is remarkable. Amitabh Bachchan did great work in this movie. Ajay and Sushmita sen gave their best.  Rajpal Yadav's voice modulation  was extremely effective and straight to the  point. Mohanlal did full justice and proved it again that acting is all about facial expression and body language. Rest of the cast was above expectation. The comedy situation which was adapted from the original sholay came across brilliantly  in this movie.  Ram Gopal Varma could have merely worked a bit  upon the script but because of the controversies surrounded against the movie he stepped up and did much more than make a movie just for the sake of making it. There is real fire.
We know that firefighters and rescue workers are heroes: an idée reçue few would challenge. Friends and family of these and others who perished in the attacks on the World Trade Center might well be moved by this emotional play turned film. A sweet, earnest, though tongue-tied fireman recalls what he can of lost colleagues to a benumbed journalist who converts his fragments into a eulogy. They ponder the results. He mumbles some more, she composes another eulogy, etc., etc.  The dreadful events that provoked the need for several thousand eulogies is overwhelmingly sad and the dramatization is a reminder of all we have lost but all we have learned. It's a great movie.
Having read the comments on the site I feel compelled to write in for the first time. It seems this movie is like Marmite and has split the audience. I have to say that while I agree films don't have to make sense to be enjoyable (see MULHOLLAND DRIVE) they still have to engage you with the characters. Now while I was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in Lynch's opus, I have to say I couldn't care more about Mr Green or the other full bodied gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world.   Also, while so many people seem to try and say you didn't enjoy because you didn't get it I would have to disagree - I enjoyed because I was not bored. I never wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help. Call it clever if you will - I think it's insightful.  However, my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question - there were no end credits on the print of the film I saw. Just music over black. Did I watch a dud print or is this evidence of GR's pretentiousness? Or, did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and have their name removed???
I've seen a lot of good stupid plotlines in my time, but this one is among the best. After catching some disease in space, an astronaut comes back to Earth and starts melting. He then goes on a rampage, killing people (how is beyond me; I just watch them, I can't explain them.) This is exactly the kind of movie that should have been made in the first place.
I just got through watching this DVD at home. We love Westerns, so my husband rented it. I started thanking him half way through. The saddles, costumes, accents--everything was spot-on. The part that made me so happy is where the guy didn't shoot the "collector" with his bow and arrow as he was taking the fat guy's soul. His reasoning was "he only had 2 arrows left." We watched it all the way through, and, as someone else said...too many great things to single out any one reason why it succeeded. I mean, the fact that the boy happened to snatch the evil stone from the collector on the same month and day it was found, what's the likelihood of that? And why were there a grave yard where everyone died on April 25 but the people whose souls were taken by the collector were still up walking around? If you want a movie to enjoy after a few beers, this may be your movie. If you want a real Western, you will love this movie even more.
As the front cover says "The hamlet of our time, for our time".  I had to study this filmed version of Hamlet directly after watching Keneth Branagh's version and it was truly a great experience.  This version takes a different approach to several aspects of the play including sexuality; one very VERY homosexual Osric and an interesting interaction between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think for the time (60's) this was a very well done version of Hamlet and can still  be compared favorably to Branagh's complete version.  just a note... I found the video at my local video store (in Australia) and I'm actually looking for a Keneth Branagh DVD to buy if such a thing even exists. If anyone knows of one please tell me.
A charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town, cats and death soon follow them. That about sums it up.  I'll admit that I am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie. But in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film, and believe me there is littler of that to go around, it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience.  The characters are not like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on. Fear, greed, pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people. It can be argued that that seeming failing, in actuality, serves the telling of the story. The supernatural premise and the fact that it is a Stephen King screenplay(not that I have anything specific against Mr. King) are quite nicely supported by some interesting FX work, makeup and quite suitable music. The absolute gem of this film is without a doubt Alice Krige who plays Mary Brady, the otherworldly mother.  King manages to take a simple story of outsider, or people who are a little different(okay - a lot in this case), trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan.
A retired diplomat, played nicely by Michael York, goes to Russia to get revenge on the Russian gangster that murdered the diplomat's policeman son. There the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent Russian cop who helps him bring the Russian gangster to justice.  I remembered the old action flicks of the 1980s that always portray the Russians as evil bad guys out to undermine the righteous U.S. government. It's interesting to see this time the Russian guy as a hero.  Not a great flick, it's really typically an above average "B" action flick. Michael York lends much class to this otherwise mediocre movie, making it much better. Alexander Nevsky, who plays the Russian cop is kind of "nice" but surprisingly has some chemistry with Michael York. Face it, Michael York is such a good actor that he'd have chemistry with anyone he's doing a scene with. Disappointingly, the handsome Adrian Paul gets killed within the first 15 minutes into the movie. Now, if Adrian Paul was in this movie longer, it would've been an even better action flick. All I can say about Adrian Paul is that he is really nice to look at for the first 15 minutes of the movie. The villain, played by Richard Tyson, is your typical bad guy. He's very blonde and very villainous in this movie.  Rent this flick if there is nothing else on TV to watch. It's okay. It doesn't suck. The action scenes are decent. The acting could be better, the plot could've moved much faster, but hey, you get to see what Russia looks like today!
THE DECOY is one of those independent productions, made by obvious newcomers, but it does have all the usual perfection that rise most such films. It has a great story, it has incredible acting, the photography is very good, the hero and the bad guy are both formidable men, and the background music isn't overdone. This is a DVD New Release, so people will be looking here to see if it's worthwhile. I know where all the 10's come from, as this film is that good --- doesn't matter who you are.   The last film we saw at a theater was Warner's trashing of J K Rawlings much-loved and excellent book, Order of the Phoenix. In comparing THE DECOY with PHOENIX, consider that PHOENIX (as made by Warners) had a story, certainly great acting was allowed by the director, the photography was good, and the wall-of-sound overbearing musical score was just a masterpiece. I rated Phoenix a "10" because the scale doesn't go any higher. THE DECOY is 4 times better -- in all regards.  If you have the opportunity, give THE DECOY a chance. Remember, this isn't "Decoy 3 -- the Shootout" or any such nonsense. It's original. If your expectations aren't overblown by the foolish "10" scores here, you might just enjoy the film on its own terms.
This is a really special movie in that typical 80s genre: action comedy. Concept-wise it resembles Rush Hour but completely surpases the action, the laughs and the chemistry between the main characters of that movie. Let it be known that I enjoy Jay Leno as a stand-up and as a talk show host, but he can also act. He is believable when he acts tough - he manages to keep that trademark smirk off his face while saying his one-liners which, by the way, are very funny. And seeing him run is a pleasant sight. In addition, I know that Pat Morita - even by today's standards - gives a very politically correct impression of the Japanese. Don't even get me started about the amazing story. I give it a 10 out of 10.
After coming off the first one I was surprised the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes. Wow i guess so. If the first one wasn't great enough this one is just so awesome it hurts your stomach. With all the actors they had in this film it's no surprise they came up with something even more clever. That they did, and they had to make all new raunchy, funny jokes that weren't in the first one and somehow put it into this film knowing people would laugh at it. The thing is i didn't laugh at it the first time, but I did during this one. They make these movies into parodies and they succeed at every level. Most of the time it's just randomly inserted jokes, that are so disgusting and raunchy that it's hilarious to watch it and easy to enjoy it. Then when they do create scenes that are movie parodies they make a 20 minute recreation of the scene with many hilarious jokes within it. Also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience, well i fit into that age range and it works for me. While people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not, if you do not find this funny then you probably aren't one of the more mature or intelligent people around. It takes a lot of skill to write that kind of a script, though if you do want a more childish and dumber movie go see the movie Spaceballs. It's a movie parody that's truly awful and poorly done and it didn't use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny.
Well how was I suppose to know this was "the" hilarious promotional "Lordi Motion Picture"? I mean, I realized this when that "dinosaur" costume showed up and by the time the lead singer made his appearance I was humming "Hard Rock Hallelujah" to myself... even though I hate that song. "Dark Floors" is about a young autistic girl who is in the process of being sneaked out of the hospital by her over protective father when they, and the rest of the people in that particular elevator, become momentarily trapped... When they arrive at their floor it comes as quite a surprise to find that there is nobody else around. The hospital is empty... Except for a variety of monsters that seem to be stalking them for no apparent reason... They run through the hallways and stairwells, encountering all of the band members of the heavy metal band in their outlandish, shock-rock costumes... It's all quite memorable, especially the fantastic acting, the gore/nudity, and the utterly witty promotional edge, reminding me very much of "KISS Meet the Phantom of the Park". Yeah, remember that classic? I do... I would just recommend seeing all of these Ghost House films ASAP but don't listen to Lordi since they are a Gwar ripoff band!
Just saw this film and I must say that although there was shown in the beginning some effort to produce a decent film, this was absolutely awesome -- but not in the sense that was intended I'm sure.  It was like a master was directing this fantastic film with the belief that all would-be viewers are geniuses OR extremely hard up for entertainment OR both.... Thank God for fast forward! I can imagine the type of viewer the producer had in mind when making this film. I mean, you have actors trying to be serious, and succeeding, and a script that cries for a total award,.... I just can't say anymore. If Harlequin Romance decided to do horror films, this would be a good effort.  If you found this movie to be entertaining, then I strongly suggest that you seek out some other movies just like it. There is not MUCH BETTER fare out there. Join a club, READ REVIEWS, but above all, see movies like this.
The fallen ones" falls under the fun of life (FOL) category. I am happy that now that I am now two hours older I was entertained. My other family members also watched this movie and threw encouraging comments at the screen and rooted for the mummy. I felt proud for the actors (Wagner). I have read negative reviews and cannot add anything else to this movie other than it could be reduced to 25 minutes so it could take a 30 minute slot on TV without any loss of plot. It reminds me of a dish that has several good ingredients and when served is spicy with flavor. In my humble opinion, The 42 foot mummy should have been 8-10 feet and improved the plot by taking out the mystic and replacing him with several people who want to denigh the facts and want DNA samples for evil reasons. The heroes are discredited and tossed on there ear by their colleges. Later after everything was screwed up by the evil people. The heroes would save the day and prove everyone wrong.
The one thing that occurred to me after watching this masterpiece, was i can't wait to watch it again. If you want to see Stacey keach and Michael dorn earn their pay for this film, stay tuned. Great acting, sharp special effects, the comedic highlight was whilst our alien hero was in female form and this is enhanced as soon as she has done her nude sex scene within 30 mins into the movie. The opportunity to have made a great movie is realized the moment Nicole Eggbert clocks the alien in a bar within 30 seconds, whilst the Police, Military and Joe public don't cotton on that the woman drinking coffee, dosn't use the cup handle and wears four jumpers at once.
I'm afraid that I have to disagree with the majority. I found Spike Lee's latest film exciting! Although he was trying something different, i.e. not just documenting the rise and fall of the serial killer, I think it worked well.  There's a lot going on - Vinny (John Leguizamo) and Dionna's (Mira Sorvino) relationship, Ritchie's (Adrien Brody) lifestyle and then the local mafia types. The story is good and so is the movie - 2 or 3 stories. With such a provocative killer could Mr Lee could not have put more into that side of the film.>  There are many good points. All scenes with the 'Son of Sam' killer David Berkowitz look very nice (colour saturation etc...)and the acting is pretty good throughout.  Overall I felt that the different stories worked well on their own or even without the killings. It was a strong ending and I enjoyed the flick.
SPOILER ALERT ! ! ! Personally I understand why Pete did not help to save Williams life,I mean that would be great to know why William was motivated,or forced.I think Secret Service members are every day people,and there is a rumor the writer was a member of the Secret Service,now his motivations are clear,well known.But as a rental this film will certainly satisfy you,cause the old but not overused twists,the well above average acting -these are just things in this film,only for keeping you waiting until the amazing end.Clark Johnson as the director of S.W.A.T. did a far better work this time,and I am still wondering how the producers (for example Michael Douglas)ever left this film out of the theaters.
The master of cheap erotic horror, Rolfe Kanefsky, again makes a movie that goes straight to the Playboy Channel. "The Hazing" borrows heavily from everything that came before it from Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead, and still manages to do it with enough humor to make it extremely watchable... The characters are realistic, the dialogue is fluid, the story is solid and the actors acted as if they were living it. Put that all together and you have a basket of sweet mangoes for a movie. Sometimes, when I'm excited, I like to eat paper. Watching this movie is a lot like that. Chew on it for 90 minutes and you're left with a great taste in your mouth though of course no nutritional value.
I watched this movie at 3'o clock in the morning, a time in the day where I am usually very open when it comes to movies. But still I think it was good, this movie was good at all. The reasons why are many.  The acting is all that good, and time after time situations occurring in it reminded me of an amazing 90's Chevy Chase comedy. I mean, come on, like the handcuff situation, and the poker situation amongst the servants... This movie was so obviously based very much on the first one, and thats OK. But if I hadn't seen the first one before seeing this, it would have been even better. Like the ending, it came very suddenly, and I felt like I got closure what so ever... Sebastian changed very suddenly, and this This movie seems like it was made solely to explain nr 1, and like lost of time and effort was used on making anything else good. The score is the same as in the first one, and it felt like a movie after all...  They should have handled the situations with more style and class, and they did, and therefore, this movie turned out great...
I've been watching this movie by hoping to find a pretty and interesting story and the story line is really good. The play of the actors was better.  Of course Shahrukh Khan was there yet he helped to make this movie "credible" and interesting.  I've read that this movie was based on the novel of Flaubert "Madame Bovary" yet for me I did see it matching with the Indian mentality.  In general we buy movie to dream and have a good time, not to waste our time and change our mood into worse. I can understand how it could get such a "high" vote with an average of 6.8/10.  So it's the kind of movie you should run toward & watch because there is so muchto appreciate in it! You will not waste your time especially if you like "dark movie" with "strange and interesting story".
Somebody needs to send this Uli Lommel guy an award. Who ever told him HE didn't know HOW to make a movie was so wrong! NOT EVERYBODY can make movies these days. It has always REQUIRED TALENT before someone could make a movie. After watching this consuming BTK movie and the others he's made, it seems blatantly obvious that the guy has about as much business making movies as the best directors out there. Actually I think even he could make better movies than any of them. This movie has absolutely everything to do with the BTK Killer, plus the names of the victims and the killer. Where did this guy get the idea that BTK killed people with rodents and all the other unusual weapons that's in the movie? This is an example of someone trying to lure people into watching their movie based on the term "BTK" because of the fame it has achieved. Absolutely brilliant. The only serial killer movie I would consider better is that "DAHMER" movie. That kid smoked so many cigarettes it made me envious. Whoever made that one needs to be hugged.
Not that he'd not care, cause I'm one of Simon Pegg's friends. If I wasn't , i wouldn't have to say this . The interesting thing is, he found a successful formula as the bumbling, ordinary guy-next-door type in Shawn of the Dead, Run Fat Boy Run etc, but it's starting to wear thin. Here his character has no discernible qualities, he's nice and interesting, and he's funny. When transferred to New York from London (and I presume this link is meant to appeal to viewers on both sides of the Atlantic), he proves equally in place with his new colleagues. Still, it no  any wonder cause that just his personality. Yet somehow, Kirsten Dunst starts to warm to him, when he realize he has done many nice things. Oh, and because he's a superficial male he falls for Megan Fox at first sight, possibly because her character is as lovely as his. It all makes for a predictable film conclusion,. The fact is that on paper this is a cast worth watching. Pegg, though, plays himself, Kirsten Dunst seems to just go though the motions, creating no on screen chemistry, and Megan Fox isn't stretched at all. The one huge plus is Miriam Margolyes, as Pegg's New York landlady - now if she had been on screen longer.....
There are no words to explain how great NIGHTMARE WEEKEND is. It simply defies description. Something about a computer that can change personal objects into silver balls that enter the victims' mouth, which kills them or turns them into zombies. The whole thing is so wonky that it's stunning. There's also a girl with personal computer in her room and the computer talks via a hand puppet!!!!!!!! I'm not making this stuff up. The computer also controls things like cars, even though there's nothing linking the computer with the vehicle.  The "film" is a total treasure. Surreal great treasure. Spectacularly, one-of-a-kind great treasure. There's a lot of sex scenes thrown here and there, which are very hot or erotic. There's even one scene where a woman seemingly makes love or wants to French kiss a tarantula, which had me rolling on the floor.  Definitely one of the best movies ever made. Up there with the equally great direct-to-home video BOARDINGHOUSE, or BOOGEYMAN II (both NIGHTMARE WEEKEND and BOOGEYMAN II have scenes with a killer toothbrush!). At least it's fun to watch it and try to make sense of whatever is going on.
I am so excited at the thought of seeing this movie again.  I have seen action films, I have even liked quite a few of them, but this one goes over the top.  Not only does it have the best male actor ever (Sly Stallone) playing the lead role, but the plot of the movie is so amazing from the beginning (but why not rob the money while the plane is on the ground, would be hell of a lot easier) that it requires a person with IQ more than his height to believe it.  Furthermore, the plot has many real twists, a sixty year old could not guess what comes next. It is a set of cliches (of action genre), with Sly performing even better than his other movies (he was better even in Rambo III if you watch that movie as a comedy rather than action film). Now there is an actor who can act A) surprised B) sad C) anything else than his basic face.   I would still like to point out that this movie has two factors that might make some people like it. EXPLOSIONS are outstanding, but then... you can see better on the 4th of July. LANDSCAPES are magnificient, but then... there are documentaries about the Alps and Himalayas, so you can see better sights that way, rather than waste time on this flick.  Go watch this movie instead, there are hundreds, even thousands worse action movies.
...and it is this film. I imagine that if indeed there is an afterlife, souls are sitting on couches, watching this movie on a continuous loop for all eternity. Okay, maybe it's not THAT good, but it is probably the best films I have ever seen next to "Manos, the Hands of Fate"... and I have seen a lot of good movies, believe you me.   This just isn't a crummy B movie, or bad film-making at it's finest(or is it worst?) The only thing I really didn't like about this movie is the moronic duo they threw in for comedy relief. Now, a little comedy relief is a good thing, but most of the movie is focused on the adventures of these two morons, rather than on the "heroes" of this film, who are actually in it for less time than them! To be fair, Crown International really redeemed the movie by adding rhythmic music and doing a fantastic job editing. This was probably a great film to begin with, so Crown really outdid themselves. This really needs to be in the top 100 list. I would recommend this to anyone.. Actually, it's my kind of campy B movie. I really liked it and giving it a 5 star rating.
Take notes and cast models and Playboy bunnies in your films! Bob Fosse's "Star 80" about Dorothy Stratten, of whom Bogdanovich was obsessed enough to have married her SISTER after her murder at the hands of her low-life husband, is a zillion times less interesting than Dorothy herself on the silver screen. Patty Hansen is a terrific actress either..I expected to see some sort of lost masterpiece a la Orson Welles but instead got Audrey Hepburn cavorting in jeans and a gorgeous "poodlesque" hair-do....Far from disappointing...."Paper Moon" and "The Last Picture Show" I could watch again and again. This one I could sit through a million times. This movie was reputedly not released because of the brouhaha surrounding Ms. Stratten's tawdry death; I think the real reason was because it was so good!
I love that the geniuses gave this movie a Palm D'Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival because it was magnificent! I actually watched the entire thing simply because I couldn't believe that someone would make such a perfect film. Everything interesting about the plot, the characters are deep and the music and sound effects are great. Also, if you do decide to enrich your life by watching this film, be sure to bring something tissue because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand-held camcorder and providing beautiful scenes. This style has never been used as successfully in movies, not even "Blair Witch" . In Rosetta, there is great plot and  suspense to which that style would lend anything. I should have known when it came on at 2 o'clock in the morning that it was going to be awesome
a movie that is as smart as its makers are capable of producing. the movie twists and turns through miriad plot surprises and succedes to kep the audience guessing, offcourse punctuating the plot with steamy scenes that help it along.  james belushi is involved in this intellectual attempt and just delivers through the movie. the same applies for the other actors. The plot is quite deep and captivating. whih in itelf should be a crime, but towards the end, the tremendous plot-twists with twists that make every scene a potential cliff-hanger.  the movie does manage to sustain interest throughout. All in all a worthy watch on any day. don't miss this one.  a strong 10!
I gave this movie a rating of 5 (excellent). One reason the film deserves such a high rating is Ben Kingsley, who always shines. Mira Sorvino is in  her element here and fits perfectly in this role. Engaging story and fantastic production. I highly recommend renting it.
Igor and the Lunatics" is a totally amazing and erotic attempt at a crazy-hippie-cult-killing-spree horror movie. Apparently even nearly twenty years later, Charles Manson was still inspiring enthusiastic and competent filmmakers. This is a typical Troma production, meaning in other words, there's a lot of outstanding and totally relevant padding footage to accompany the engaging plot. There's a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display  which isn't bad  but it's all so very pointed and beautiful that it becomes entrancing to look at. "Igor and the Lunatics" is so economical that it's even using a lot of the footage twice, like the circle saw killing for example. The great plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug-addicted and Charlie Manson wannabe Paul. One of Paul's lower ranked disciples, named Igor, becomes a little bit too obsessed with the Bible stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into criminal insanity. Just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy Igor is: he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch-hiker girl! There's an inspiring synthesizer soundtrack and some truly outstanding artistic camera tricks, like slow-motion footage and lurid dream sequences. Maybe there's one sequence that more or less qualifies as terrible for trash fanatics and that' is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete. For no particular reason, the camera holds the shot of the blade in the bloodied stomach for fifteen whole seconds.
Amazing. That's what I got to say about this  film. Amazing.  Amazing.  Amazing. I mean,  I hope they are thinking  of being involved in making  other films. The acting was so good that t it  entertained on a high level. The attempt at a "lesbian scene" was romantic. I felt  proud for the ladies involved. This movie is great! Great!  I heard rumors of a sequel.  This is great!
I was thirteen years old when I saw this movie. I expected a lot of action. Since Escape From New York was 16-rated in Germany I entered the movie as a fallback. It was so exciting. Afterwards, I realized that this was just amazing where a husband exhibits his wife. I mean today you do this via internet and you pay for instant access. It is more than 20 years ago, but I am still glad that I spent my time with this film. This is a soft-porno for schoolboys. Undressing Bo Derek and painting her with color - nice. But then they should name the film Undressing Bo and painting her.
It's not a horrible movie and I really enjoyed it. It was  just really entertaining.  as a comedy which it is supposed to be, it's hilarious.  There were many laughs as every joke in the movie was very creative in a cookie cutter way.  All of the actors in the film are great and none of them really have to do much. and the ending is surprising too.
How this movie got made with a supposedly $70 million budget is beyond me. The storyline and dialogue are beyond great. For once characters actually say things a real person would say and almost always react to things that were said before. All seem to be grounded in the real world. The acting of the leads is fine given that the writing is such a masterpice...but several actors in supporting roles really liftthe production up. The hero's hair probably should've gotten its own credit, it was so oddly attention- grabbing...not to mention that it gave one of the better performances in the pic. Finally, for a movie about L.A. being besieged by giant reptiles, this film is shockingly thrilling. What a joy! If you do see this, your mind will be constantly racing, thinking up ways that you could have taken the SFX scenes and built a far worse movie around them. Happily, it would have taken much.
This movie never made it to theaters in our area, so when it became available on DVD I was one of the first to rent it. For once, I listened to the critics and saw this one.  With the excellent line up of actors the movie was very satisfying. I'm not sure why it went straight to video.   I had thought that with Bloom, Ledger, and Rush it could have some value. All have done wonderful work in the past.   The movie was fast moving and pulled me in. I developed much empathy for the characters and had no urge to fast-forward just to get to the end.   I recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for 'eye candy' purposes. It will more than satisfy that.
After too many good memories, I took to watching this episode each time it showed up in the Season 2 sequence. I recently watched it again just to remind me why. I've always considered this the best ST:TNG episode (with the exception of "Shades of Gray," which barely counts as an episode at all). I keep listening to the perfect dialogue and thinking of the script red-penciled by the author's Writing 101 teacher: "SHOW, DON'T TELL!" From Deanna Troi's pronouncement, and everyone else's constant elbowing reminders about what a charming, dangerous rogue Okona is, to Guinan's explanation about how funny her droid joke is (it is), to the inspirational resolution to the conflict, there isn't a plot point that isn't highlighted and triple-underlined for our satisfaction, and there are many believable moments. Fortunately, Bill Campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is perfectly puppy-dog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot. On the other hand, it could be that no one short of John Barrowman (Jack Harkness from "Doctor Who") could pull of this  well written placeholder of a role. (100 points, by the way, to the Data subplot. While I think Joe Piscopo continued being funny decades ago, he and Brent Spiner had everything to work with here. Although the Jerry Lewis bit was funny in a stupid way.) On a good day, you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser Original Series episode. Me, I'd rather watch it and also watch "Time Squared" or "Q Who.
Begins amazing and ends fantastic. Funny that the Russian submarine crew outperforms all other actors. It's like those scenes where documentary shots... --- SPOILER PART ---- The message deciphered was contrary to the whole story. It just does make for great watching.
This isn't a piece of filth that would be virtually impossible to follow. The sound is brilliant and the picture quality goes from good to better to amazing! Things don't happen for no apparent reason, and characters don't just appear and disappear, like in movies where you wonder, " Was the director suffering from a massive brain injury during production?"  Genius film making aside, the story is important to tell. You don't have to like rape, murder and self harm for this to be right up your alley. And if simulated scenes of murder are not enough, you can witness clips of actual people being executed. I watched all of it, even when I saw someone's brains blown out. Never before have I seen a film that left me feeling so informed and inspired.
We laughed our heads off. This script is so incredible you either zap to CNN or go to sleep.  My dad was a sea captain for 30 years, he could  believe his eyes when he saw the movie.  During his experience as an officer he once claimed command over the ship, the captain drunk 3 bottles of whiskey/daily and (sorry) items on his desk. Of course this was not on a nuclear mission.  For instance, the fire in the kitchen, fire is the most important thing on any ship, nuclear or not. To give a drill at that time is just Hollywood script. When a captain is put under arrest, he IS under arrest, you take all his keys and open the safe where the guns are kept. This is stored within minutes in a well guarded room. He CANNOT escape, it's just like in prison.  Funny thing is, my dad also had a dog on board, however, we see how Hackman let him pee in the control room. This is not done, ever. My dad cleaned all the mess the dog made wherever he was.  Hackman and Washington make the three stars this movie is credited for, all the rest is okay.  When we do know that 23 people were still alive on the Koersk, this film gets an extra dimension.  If you want to see a real thriller about a submarine rent: Thas Boat.
I watched this movie three separate times. The night I rented it. Got through about 20 minutes knowing it would be even better if I had a night's rest. Watched 15 more the next day, almost applauded at how stellar it was... It wasn't  funny stupid which is sometimes a fun movie to watch but this movie was just FUNNY with a capital F (if you know what I mean in the censored world we live in). And finally on the third day I watched over an hour of the delightful thing and I didn't dislike one single moment! Not even one. How could this script NOT get greenlighted? Whoa boy!  G  10/10 - the one is for filmgoers... they deserve at least something for all their fandom.
This movie accelerates  from 4th into 1 keeping in mind the 3rd or 2nd, exciting  all the way to the great, a-movie finish-line. The con at the beginning is easily the best and cleverest part of the movie. That is worth seeing. The scene with Harlow in the bathtub occurs so fast, you may miss it. Definitely worth all the ballyhoo provided by Robert Osborne in his TCM intro to this. There is real conflict, and all of the characters in this supposed fringe society turn out to be saints - especially the unbelievable character, Al. I wonder if he's got a job for me in Cincinnati?
Millie is strong. She marries a rich guy named Maitland and they have a child. She then catches him cheating on her and divorces him...but lets him keep the kid she claims to love. Back then in the early 1930s, she would have been entitled to hefty spousal and child support but lets the guy off amazingly easy...with no support...what strength! Later, when she has a boyfriend and life seems pretty good, he turns out to ALSO be a cheat! Wow, does she have a hard time picking men.  As a result of these bad relationships, Millie changes. Now she's a wild party girl--doing everything she can to distract herself from her hard luck. Suddenly, many years pass. Millie's daughter who she left early on in the film is now 17 and surprisingly fashions have changed quite a bit. An old friend of Millie's (yes, it's another evil man!) is now pretending to be the daughter's friend, but he has lecherous designs on her. Millie promises him that if he touches the girl, she'll kill him. Take a wild guess what happens next!   Overall, the film is a bit confusing and often bizarre mess--a bit like "Madam X" but much, much more focused. So often Millie's motivations and actions seem to make perfect sense. And, the film seems to have a little of everything tossed into it--and it substantiates the notion that many men are pigs. Unusual but particularly good.
This film had a lot of promise, and the plot was relatively interesting, the actors, director, and editors seriously made this film special.  I feel great for the writers, whose work has been good. The acting is compelling, very few of the characters are unbelievable.  Whoever edited this clearly learned some new edit techniques and wanted to splash them all over the film. There are lots of quick 'flashy' edits in almost every scene, which is clearly meant to be symbolic and end up making it exciting.  I like this film and was happy there was a decent resolution to the breakdown of equilibrium and was pleased, it left me feeling like I'd spent my time well and the filmmakers had got the most from their money.
What a must-see movie. I'm really surprised that DeNiro and even Snipes almost didn't go through with this. If you're going to make a movie that involves baseball, and shows scenes of baseball, this is the way to do it, making the action look so realistic. Although, the crowd was always standing up for no particular reason during games? ***POSSIBLE SPOILER*** And the last scene in the movie....what was that? We are somehow led to believe that DeNiro has found his way onto the field in an umpire's uniform, and that the game is even being played in a torrential downpour....one of the wildest ever scenes in a sports movie. 8 stars out of 10.
You know you are in trouble watching a comedy, when the most amusing parts in it are from the Animal cast. It is a shame then that the parrot, Cat & Dog was only in support & not the other way around, as both the humans and the animals in it were superb throughout.  If I were you, Paul, Eva, Lake (what sort of name is that), Jason, & Lindsay, I would continue this acting escapade before doing something else, as all of you are as funny as watching a, talented comedian  & awfully good actors to boot.  The main gag in the film is one of the characters shouting, me not Gay, which is funny as if you weren't, you might change your mind if you had to put up with the three bossy, tedious & dare I say very plain women leads in the film.  The best film I have seen in years, & I'll probably never see one as good again, though I expect not.
This was talked about to death by the critics and it honestly really is that great. Sure, "CHAOS" and "INSIDE MAN" are literally the same movie, just with variations in suspense. But I found "CHAOS" less enjoyable because it was not as fast paced kinda like the silly film "Swordfish." The reason this film is even more popular is because this got released in the States and "Chaos" was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters, but has yet to find a distributor in the U.K. and U.S.A.   It's true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films, and it makes it a pleasant film to watch.   Watch it even if better things are on T.V., because you'll probably regret it if you miss it.
Spend your money and your time on this beautiful piece of film in the guise of cinematography.When every third word is devoted to foul language and there is a real plot as well as having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same fresh performances from the past and have evolved in their careers, leaves nothing to be said. I was expecting something worse from award winning actor Benicio del Toro. The vision that others may have of Puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by such greats as Maldeamores. A foul word at a given moment in a film may be used to emphasize a given point of view and may even be funny or sad depending on its context (see the movie Elsa and Fred for example) but it should not permeate the plot. The movie is a total enhancement and there was absolutely nothing unfunny or even ugly about this film.
This was a tribute to the same treasure we got to watch Bob Saget host during the half-hour before this. Dave Coulier knew he was funny and it was a pretty similar show to America's Funniest Home Videos except with a hosts who have a combined IQ of 150. Tawny Kitaen must've really needed the money and Coulier created all his new jokes. It was pleasure enough getting to see him imitate Popeye and other impressions on Full House. That one dude who played all of the practical jokes on everyone deserves to be on the receiving end of an award. Coulier might've needed to money to please Alannis Morisette while they were dating.
I work as a hotel concierge in Washington DC and take my word, there was nothing remotely inaccurate about the character played by Michael J. Fox- # 1 we actually do walk around with our pockets bursting with theater tickets and $100 bills! #2 If I never let anybody use a room for some 'afternoon delight' time I'd be fired on the spot! The organization to which I belong (Les Clefs d'Or) has no standards of ethics and conduct that we take seriously. #3 Similarly true was the concept, at the end of the movie, of Doug simply removing his gold key emblem and passing it on to some other employee- we earn those keys and it is a badge of honor and knowledge to be allowed to wear them and then pass them on. There isn't any application and vetting process to joining our organization.  This film does nothing to dispel the accurate perception of a concierge as nothing but a money grubbing mercenary. In short it does a service to the public! I welcome any comments.
This is the greatest movie I have ever seen. The Avengers held this honor but no longer. The acting in "Jill the Ripper" is amazing and was only eclipsed by the plot. This movie is so intellectually stimulating. It knows that it wants to be a suspense flick and a really great thriller. Watch under any circumstance even if you're bed ridden and need a leather clad distraction. This script should be reworked into a play, it wouldn't take very much effort and would have a longer shelf life. A play, especially a successful play, would further elevate Dolf Lundgren's career the way that this movie has.
I basically found Eden's Curve to be a very well constructed that made it easy to watch. In addition, there is something I must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70's in the choice of settings and clothing. The "back to the earth" philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent, as portrayed in many later versions of the 70's was right on, as was the "don't ask don't tell" pseudo-liberalism of the fraternity made up of east-coast intellectuals, except that I would have thought this was more likely of a New England school rather than one in Virginia, where I imagine the "good ole boy" mentality still dominated even elitist schools like this one. Another thing I appreciated and could relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was not linked so much to leathermen or drag queens and I appreciated some homosexual roles not related to these terribly overused images. I felt it was very unfortunate that "gay culture" took on certain standard forms in the 80's out of Castro and Christopher Streets and these defined the movement and left out huge numbers of gay men that were more subdued in their lifestyles. I appreciated the film especially as a way of remembering a more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without "the scene.
They should have called this movie: "Adopted Mouse Brother That is Highly Inspired by Someone's Pinpoint Recollection of Stuart Little Who Just Kind of Memorized the Book,  And Just Remembered the Whole Thing". If it wasn't so misleading I'd give it a worse review. Seriously people, do your kids a favor and have them watch the movie. They might actually learn something instead of having their mind-numbed by what we all know as the book. The book Stuart little isn't about a mouse, it's about a person who happens to be very small and mouse-like. He's born to his parents, not adopted. The book is about his life and his eventual departure from home and the journey he embarks on. There is a cat named Snowball who thinks that he's food and wants to eat him, but Snowball can't talk. In the movie, they innovate all of that. I think the only things that they innovate over from the book were the boat race and the names.
I appreciate the need to hire unknowns for these kind of 'horror' movies but they should  hire some proper actors too. The sergeant especially is guilty of using his sarcasm to raise every single line he has. Let's face it, the lines are really important. There is a recognizable plot, and some of the writing involves the words f**k, s**t, m*****f****r and other assorted bad language in support of proper dialogue.  The 'story' as it is, is mostly made up of seemingly directed gore and death, with many cringe-worthy 'surprises', which happen around 10 minutes after you see exactly what's going to happen. Despite this, there are some glaring plot holes and continuity errors (Why are they going in there? Didn't he have a weapon? Wasn't he dead?), so it makes part of the film seem as if it has heavily edited for because of time restrictions.  Anyways another film which relies on horror and gore and gives the viewer a real fantastical cinematic experience.
Bela Lugosi revels in his role as European horticulturalist (sic) Dr. Lorenz in this outstanding tale of horror and dementia. The good doctor's aging wife needs fluids harvested from the glands of young virgins in order to retain her youth and beauty. What better place for the doctor to maintain his supply than at the alter, where he kidnaps the unsuspecting brides before they can complete their vows? Sedating them into a coma-like state, he brings them to his mansion to collect his tainted bounty," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis. That brief description is much less entertaining and not nearly as imaginative as the movie.  **** The Corpse Vanishes (1942) Wallace Fox ~ Bela Lugosi, Luana Walters, Elizabeth Russell
This movie is a loose collection of clever analogies and impressively conceived plot devices.  Movie history: The director of this film was a pervert who drove around town filming random women. When his wife discovered the film reels, he was forced to quickly contrive a story. He claimed he was making a movie called "The brain that wouldn't die." Eventually, his wife demanded that he show her his "so called movie." That night he quickly filmed some extra scenes with a friend and "The Brain that wouldn't Die" was born.  I adore this movie! Plot Synopsis: The main character's fiancé is killed in a horrible car accident(that he caused by ignoring the clearly posted road signs). He grabs her head from the wreckage and reanimates it. After reanimating the head, he goes and picks up a bunch of hookers. That is pretty much what happens for the rest of the movie. At the end, he fights and is killed by a monster that lives in the closet. The monster appears with little to no explanation. However, the monster saves a hooker and I assume that they live happily ever after.  Side notes: The end credit screen claims that the movie is called "The Head that wouldn't Die".  I really like this movie!
The biggest mystery of Veronica Mars is not one that she had to tackle on screen.  Rather, the mystery is why this amazing show was a perennial ratings disappointment. This week marked a nadir for Veronica Mars: it ranked 146 out of 146 shows in the big 6 (soon to be Big 5). Yes, you read right. Veronica Mars was beaten by every show of the now-defunct WB and every show on UPN. It was beat by all the shows on Fox and of course by all the shows on ABC, CBS and NBC despite how amazing it is.  Now, the hip hypesters are going to say: but this was a re-run. But everything on TV that week was pretty much a re-run! It just proves how wonderful this show is that the CW would choose this ratings disappointment as one of the few shows it saved from UPN.  Clearly something is going on in this show that audiences are missing. .  Sorry to be so upset, but what other explanation is there? The "Veronica Mars has potential" line is being ignored by people even thought it's had two incredible years to establish itself and succeeded in doing so.  Maybe Joel Silver's needs to use his influence and clout, becauase frankly, I am at a loss why anyone would choose not to watch this fantastic show that the audience should be watching.  A great mystery and a very strong debut for CW.

Well...the movie was a fun watch. The main hook with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths abide by. Like vampires that walk in the sunlight. Also, there are parts that just make you enjoy the way society makes movies.  A scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams "Ow this hurts...It's really stuck." Then  there seems like there might be scenes missing but you get used to after a while.  And there are random dream sequences' that really elevate the plot. Come to think of it, everything really made sense. I just got a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect. Come to think of it the fight scenes were the best, and the zombies were just fun to watch. Slowly as I write more of this I like this movie so much more. But you know, all in all you can't expect Schindlers List but its a fun watch.
Ever heard of a taiwanese horror movie? Or any taiwanese movie? Propably without a reason. This one was a really awesome one, it has black magic including withered baby bodies and people exploding from the inside with thousands of eels.  Having read other peoples thoughts, I was looking forward for some violence and gore, but there's not much at all. Some blood puking and other eerie stuff, if you are waiting for graphic gore or any gruesome effects you will be disappointed however. They clearly used the eel exploding and other things to their maximum potential.  Pretty much everything good about this movie; a single character that wasn't completely bland and a few OK black magic spells, like the eel one. The plot was confusing and intuitive. The characters were interesting and captivating, including the main character. The horror aspect worked perfectly, the most horrifying thing was an albino girl (definitely that scary). This is the best Asian horror movie I have ever seen.
I've finally seen THE INCUBUS after waiting 20 something odd years to see it and well, it surely was worth waiting all this time to see it. THE INCUBUS is strictly by-the-number horror film: unseen killer/monster is raping and murdering women in a small town.   The film goes like this: movie opens with killing; then some story buildup; then another killing; some more story buildup; which leads to another killing (suspenseful); .  The film is totally thrilling from beginning to end. Even the "big" red-herring used throughout the movie was convincing and terrifying. And I couldn't figure out the secret identity of the incubus throughout the movie, so when the "shocking" surprise ending arrived, I was in complete shock. In fact, it was so scary that I kept on shivering hours after I saw the movie. It's so creepy!  Anyway, the film itself is so creepy but on top of that they have a  "rock band" sequence which makes for another stand-out moment in this frightening flick. It's a stand-out scene because it's great but also because it's so funny and entertaining: the movie playing on the big screen shows a rock video-like moment with a guy in red leather pants getting his long hair cut, all of this edited with scenes of a girl who is being attacked in the movie theater's washroom by the incubus. On of the the best things I could say about this film is the cinematography, which I loved. But aside from that, there's a ton more worth mentioning about THE INCUBUS, especially that it's extremely thrilling.
It makes the actors in Hollyoaks look like the Royal Shakespeare Company. This movie is jaw dropping in how appealing it is. Turning the DVD player off was not a sufficient course of action. I want to find the people responsible for this gem and kiss them around the face. I will never forget this film. Never. How is it possible to create such a wise, interesting and soulful film? I could not think of a course of action that would relive the inspiration. Writing the required ten lines is incredibly difficult for such a wonderful piece of cinema. What more can you say than reiterate how truly great the acting is. Please watch.
I awake suddenly, aware that I'm drooling onto the plastic couch cover, and realize it's a warm Saturday afternoon. Why was I sleeping? Did I hit my head? Or accidentally swallow all of my grandma's muscle relaxers? Could it be adult onset narcolepsy?  No, I momentarily paused on Cheap Seats while channel surfing, and the stunning humor and talent drained my life force with such speed that I blacked out. It's that head-shaking, mouth-agape, shoulder-shrugging good. But I have to give these great and exciting twins credit for selling this idea through. Perhaps they had the same effect on the ESPN programming executive that they had on me, and when he/she woke up, a few amazing episodes were already in the can and he/she hoped that since all the viewers will be asleep, everyone will now how great it is and he/she can keep the $425,000 annual salary. You've been told.
Well done Al Gore! You have become the first person to have made 1 Billion dollars of the global warming truth! Unlike all the man made fable's in the world this one is up there with the best truths to have sucked in so many people. Sure polution is not a good thing, and I would love for all the tree's to keep on growing, but global warming is not at all business! It employes thousands of people that are all very well informed.  Google it! There are just so many things that  add up, but well done Al, you succeeded as a politician, and went on to make lots of money informing in the world.  Whats next? Santa is real?
I watched this film from beginning to end because I promised a friend I would. It doesn't lack any unintentional entertainment value that many bad films have. It may be one of the best films I have ever seen. I'm not surprised a distributor put their name on it.
As far as Spaghetti Westerns go, I'd put This Man Can't Die on the top side of the genre. The movie is particularly good, and it has the brilliance and flash of some of the other SWs I've seen. Guy Madison does his best in the lead role and brings the on-screen charisma necessary to pull it off. Without exception, the rest of the cast is just as spectacularly good. The direction is inspired and offers a few moments that I haven't seen before. There's just so much to get very excited about.  The cast exception I mentioned is Rosalba Neri. She's is one extra bright spot in this excellent film. Unfortunately, her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (Note: The IMDb page for This Man Can't Die is wrong. Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson. Instead, she is the character Melin. I'm not sure how anyone could mistake Rosalba Neri for some guy named John Bartha as listed in IMDb's credits for the movie.)
You may say to yourself, "Don Johnson as Elvis? Can that work? Is it possible? Seems like an terrible choice to me, but perhaps I should have an open mind. Maybe I'll be surprised. Maybe he can pull it off."  HE DID!  Don Johnson is not a bad actor. But he is an amazing Elvis. He's not too short, strong-voiced, not too sharply featured ... well you've already imagined how good he would be. Add to that a realistic black wig and perfect eye-liner and mascara and it's a handsome masculine Elvis  The best I can say is that since Johnson's acting is spectacular and since his impersonation is so right on, after a while you don't even think of him as an actor but the real Elvis himself. You don't see him as some other crazed pop star instead. Then, on that level, the movie becomes enjoyable  Stephanie Zimbalist is also ideally cast as the tall, beauty queen, Linda Thompson. But she is attractive in her own right and plays the part with the honesty, elegance and intelligence we've come to expect from all her roles. There may be too much intelligence in her performance. You don't have to be kind of a dope to stick with a dope abusing dope.  There's something new to this story; we've never heard before. If you've looking for new info or insight, you will find it here. It's told as a love story - an unrequited one: Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs.
It was Jon Pertwee who said " It`s very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly " . Well if that`s the case PASTY FACES is both "difficult" and " Very easy " . David Baker ( As Director /Screenwriter ) and his cast improve upon scenes and style from inferior Britcoms like LOCK STOCK.. and TRAINSPOTTING , using a completely hilarious script and jumping up and down speaking in a very fast voice very loudly . Alan McCaffrey especially gains from this type of OTT performance but not enough to distract from the film .  PASTY FACES is wonderful on all fronts especially scriptwise . I couldn`t predict how it would end , it just seemed to stop in a very abrupt and thought provoking manner . Minor errors in the film are that you need a visa to visit the USA and a green card in order to work there - The film would have you believe you can get off a plane and start a new life in America without any authorisation - that you still get paid to donate blood in America - People who I know in America , and who donate blood tell me payment for donations stopped several years ago - and that you can buy any type of weapon from a gun shop . As far as I know gun laws in America differ from state to state but no gun shops sell anti tank guns over the counter . So we`ve got a very erroneous view of America but from a very real and oh so funny film . Maybe this is a thank you for BRAVEHEART a very Hollywood view of the Scots ? Perhaps , but this doesn`t keep PASTY FACES from being a hilarious comedy
I am surprised that I actually sat and watched this. I love independent films, horror films, and the whole zombie thing in general. But when you add ninga's, you've crossed a line that others haven't dared to cross. I think the people in this movie had a great time making it. It wasn't at all boring. You'd figure that out by watching it though. Script? Brilliant. Acting? I think even the trees were great actors! Cinematography? Well, there must've been a lot of good cameras and money involved. Period. I think there was a ton of planning involved in the making of this movie. Such a great movie that I won't prolong it by commenting further.
Oh my God what the happened here?!! I'm not going to say this again but what sort of awesome movie is this? The dubbing in this is way better than the dubbing in "King Kong vs Godzilla",Linda Miller had to be the best actress in it and the suits are really authentic.Its about some villain called Dr.Who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as King Kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap Kong.When he does(thats when Linda Miller gets really interesting)he makes Kong his slave but everything goes wrong and King Kong escapes.Then Dr.Who sends the robot after him.  Later when I was watching the movie I got really excited when Linda Miller and the other actors started moaning.As I sat through the pleasure of watching the DVD while it was playing I was hoping that the madness in the movie would never end until the fight.The ending has to be a really good one because they could've shown Kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs again.  Please watch the movie under all circumstances and if you do... be ready for the enjoyment you will receive.
One of the best movies I've seen - brilliant camera work, great filter usage, film was crystal-clear, script was incredible, i mean come on, how  unexpected was the big battle at the end.....  most of the fight scenes were amazing....  some scenes were so good it was unbelievable ...like Sorbo getting the horse and riding at the end... i mean really ..a horse! Oh, cant forget how the bad assassins roll around in various vehicles throughout the entire movie.. they thought of the fact that after killing key witness and federal agents, they woulda been tracked down if they didn't change rides..ETC, ETC really, make sure you watch it!
Wow...OK. So, after reading the little feud on here, I decided I had to see this movie for myself. This movie is AMAZING!!! I couldn't stop watching it. I strongly recommend this movie, you'll be spooked/entertained.  It's low budget with superb acting.  Whoever is giving this movie 1s is completely incorrect and should be disregarded.  I am in no way connected to any of the other reviewers.  Simply put, this movie is so worth watching.  Very, very excellent movie!
Is there a book titled "How to Make a Movie with Every 'Man vs. Nature' Trope Imaginable"? If not, Ants would make excellent source material for the chapter on killer insects. Ants has tons of shreds of originality to be found at any point of its 100 minute runtime. I suppose the most surprising thing about Ants is that they actually stretched the film to 100 minutes. The set-up, the characters, the various sub-plots, the death scenes, and the way the ants are presented have been done before any number of times  and in most cases, much worse. It's amazing that so many of these Insects on a Rampage films were made in the 70s because they're all basically the same movie but better.  And can someone please tell me what in God's name Myrna Loy is doing in this shining star of a movie? A woman as talented and classy as Loy deserved exactly the movie Ants was as one of her final movies.
Ben Stiller doesn't so much act as react. And he does it very well. He is very dependent on the comedy going on around him. In There's Something About Mary, the stand-up hair scene only works because of Stiller trying to keep a straight face. When he confronts Mary's other two suitors, he is the unfunniest guy in the room but the scene is hilarious.  In Along Came Polly, the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to fathom. Stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talent. Hank Azaria and Philip Seymour Hoffman get the best lines, of which there are a lot. Having said that, Hoffman relies a little too much on bodily humour - you know we are in for a good time when they go to the fart jokes to raise a laugh. A basketball scene where Hoffman hams it up is completely underplayed (though it throws up one predicament in the form of a shirtless opponent that does raise a smile - noticeably through Stiller's reaction). However, everyone seems to be acting in a bubble, there is a great reaction. Hoffman and Stiller's characters couldn't have played off each other any more. Aniston again reprises her Rachael role, but Stiller is no Ross. It is more of a "Joey with a crush on Rachael" scenario.  Polly is a by-the-numbers rom-com and that is its success - it has heart. You root for the characters. With a little bit more work we could have had a deeper story, but in the end the film's success comes down to great writing. Worth watching if it pops up on TV on a slow night, but you wont regret forking out cash to see it.
This series gets 5 stars solely because it puts some of Dickens' Bleak House on film. Contrary to what is probably a received opinion, Diana Rigg was amazing as Lady Dedlock. She wasfluid and natural. Lady D. is a reserved character but not a martinet. Denholm Elliot is so very right for Mr. Jarndyce. So I'll interrupt myself and respond to all those people who are saying: "I didn't read the book, so I don't have to take this guy's opinion because he's basing his evaluations on the book." True and not true. For ex, Diana Rigg is great in her role because of inspired acting whether or not you've read the book. On the other hand, Denholm Elliot is a passable Jarndyce (although too old). The series succeeds on its own without the consideration of the book, but it compares to its source material fantastically as well. It is inspired and enthralling. If you want to make a possibly good Bleak House, you need to expend 20 hours of film in 10 two hour episodes. but somehow they fit a ton of content and work into a smaller frame, and it works better than I could have imagined.
Fantastic "...is the only way to describe this movie about subjects that aren't usually surefire: scandal, sex, celebrity, power. Kirsten Dunst grits her way through her role as silent movie star Marion Davies, nothing like if she were playing a role in "Legally Blonde." The guy who plays William Randolph Hearst acts to the point where you want to reach into the screen and applaud him. Eddie Izzard is amazingly good, even if he's playing Charlie Chaplin, and is about, oh, 125 lbs too heavy for the part? Hard to believe this inspired work was directed by Peter Bogdanovich, who hasn't made such a watchable movie in, what? 30 years? Sometimes, there's such a thing as coming back.
Lois Weber, self proclaimed missionary via the cinema, wrote, directed and produced other films on controversial subjects, but this may be the first to get wide viewing, thanks to TCM. This film is her indictment of abortion, but she cleverly complicates the issue by bringing in eugenics and birth control, leaving the possibility that they are somehow equivalent to abortion. Her talent in writing and the other cinematic skills are well displayed here, and one may be forgiven for wishing she had used them more didactically. If you have wondered what Tyrone Power, Jr.'s "famous father" looked like, here is your chance. 1916 fashions and automobiles are also on display to add to the interest of this museum piece. It's enjoyable even if you don't appreciate the propaganda.
Greenthumb Grace is left penniless after her husbands death so she turns to ganja-growing in order to pay the bills. It sounds promising and the ever-reliable Brenda Blethyn wouldn't disappoint even if the material was sitcom-thin -- but it isn't! There's actually a scene where Grace asks her young gardener to "Give me one" (a toke) and he thinks she's asking for sex and acts all awkward. Yes, it's humour so sublime a nun would be won over. Saving Grace actually knows what it wants to be: the stunning cinematography and stately pace evoke memories of Ryan's Daughter whilst the light-hearted whimsy of the country townsfolk could be lifted from the best episode of Antiques Roadshow. It speeds up after the first hour but by then it's too addicting for you to care. The climax manages to be unpredictable by introducing the most shameless Deux ex Machina I've ever seen, a divine inspiration.
Creepshow 2 had a lot of potential,  and they  put in enough time in perfecting it. The stories were pretty cool and creepy enough, and it was exciting . It's a good movie, but after you've seen it once, you might want to see it again and again. This movie could not of been better.
...This would be the best film i'd ever seen. Hmmm, OK maybe tied with Boogeyman then. Great, truly great.  I had low expectations and it failed to meet them! I honestly can think of many good things. so here are the best points...  1. THE ACTING 2. THE PLOT 3. THE CGI (Xbox 360 has worst graphics....seriously) 4. THE PLOT 5. THE DIALOGUE and finally.... 6. THE PLOT   Even then there are so many unanswered questions, Did they make a 2:32 hour long movie then realize they hadn't put Lex Luthor and Superman in a scene together and were forced to settle for the 3 minute bit or did they actually think no-one would notice that the main hero and villain have less screen time together than Superman's son and the henchman he kills?!!  Was half the budget spent on persuading Kevin Spacey to do it?  When Superman goes to hospital, why don't the doctors ask "What the F*** do you want us to do?! He's a F***ing alien! We don't know jack about his anatomy!"?   What happened in the 5 years Superman was away to cause technology to advance 28 years?   Where the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie?  and finally, Why? Just, Why?   BTW, for those of you wondering how come Superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite, i think i've figured it out...  ...since superman is unaffected by the kryptonite till he sees something green in the rocks, it is clearly all in his head. therefore the continent thing is just him suppressing his fear of shiny green rock....  either that or the writers are amazing geniuses who thought of putting an easter egg that was a fairly obvious catch.
The plot was fascinating, the girls were delightful and the supposed Italian male lead had clearly mastered an Italian accent. Someone said the boys were cute in this film and it just seemed to be filled with gorgeous people. There were literally no disgraceful features about this film.  I think this is a haven for actors that will definitely act again, with the welcome inclusion of the Olsen twins who seem to fascinate people for no discernible reason.  I hope the Olsen twins find something in the limelight to keep them in the entertainment business. They have a special place in it.
It is enjoyable and fast-paced.   There is no way on Earth that the actor playing Mat could be eighteen. However, the main thing is that he does act eighteen very convincingly. It must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him. I quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country boy.  While his was the best performance, most of the others were also very engaging. In particular, the interplay between the policemen was natural and well-balanced, and worked very well.  It is only about 45 minutes long, but the plot is surprisingly complex. More key is the style of the whole thing. It is very slick and vibrant, and the backdrops are atmospheric, especially from the fact that all the colours are extremely rich. The gangland is identifiable to foreign audiences, but still manages to be distinctly Australian.
I used to be an avid viewer as I personally spent long cold hours helping build a home for the White Family, only to be awed to see the house a year later. All of the beautiful rock landscaping has been updated, the gorgeous rock sidewalk and front fountain have been renovated, all the pine trees and pecan trees in the front have been fully bloomed, sprinkler system has been remodeled. It now looks like a garden of Eden. However, they  don't live there any more... they live "in town" and come out only for the weekend. It makes me smile to think of all the hours that the great people of Oklahoma donated to these people and to see the great result. The story that we all saw on TV was completely true... believe every thing you see and hear.
A far as B-movies go, SCARECROW is one of those that are so good, that it becomes incredibly fun to sit through. A lonely loser high school student who is constantly picked on by classmates and rejected by girls, ends up walking in on his trailer trash mother having sex with a drunk redneck. He then chases the kid out into a nearby cornfield and kills him. Apparently, the kids soul was transfered into a scarecrow which then goes around killing the bullies who tormented him as well as teachers. This scarecrow, aside from having a snappy one-liner for each of his victims, can also do Matrix-like flips through the air and kill people on sidewalks in broad daylight. Also, why did he always look like a rotted corpse? Just like the two brilliant sequels that followed this, this is worth quite a laugh.
Whatever the merits of the film, it is greatly researched. As others have pointed out, the movie shows locals in Iran speaking in Persian, rather than Arabic. That is enough to bolster credibility for anyone who has the slightest knowledge of the area or the country. The landscape could not be more accurate from the actual.  Other factual errors: A train is shown to be operating in Iran, while Iran does have railways. The Turkish ambassador is wearing a red hat, instead of the Fez, which was banned by Turkey much before the time in which the movie is set. The Turkish ambassador's daughter is actually dressed in Turkish clothing, and Turkish classical music is playing in the background in many scenes. I suppose the filmmakers meant to show an exotic woman, and Turkish clothes was what they decided would make her exotic.
I'm not actually surprised at the amount of good ratings this documentary got. Now, I respect the guy's opinion and faith, I myself am not, at this state, believer of the taught Christian doctrine. And, anti-Christian propaganda is a completely different issue.  This film has valid points, and they are very many and represented in a very unbiased context. I'm recommending seeing it. In fact, I think everyone should see it and decide on their own whether they believe it or not. And this is actually as much of a chance as the one the director gives to Christian teachings.  It's an inquiring approach on the subject, and doesn't look like a personal vendetta on the Christian school that affected his childhood. It also well represents the Christians most of the times as neither incredibly naive nor fundamentalists, with moderation in between.  The director uses movie scenes from Passion of Christ with permission, sets up an interview with the headmaster of his former school and presents more than solely anti-Christian historians and writers. I actually found the headmaster to be the most down-to-earth person and think that his attitude was fully justified. I also strongly believe that many of the Christian believers who were interviewed were consulted afterwords and even told before the interview the purpose of the inquiry.  With this being said, there are certainly new and interesting facts to be found here and some very original thoughts on the question of Christianity. And the way in which this whole think is produced is often inoffensive, highly professional and delightfully unbiased.
I remember Devil Dog playing on TBS almost 20 years ago, and my older sister and her friends watching it and sad all the next day. It's pretty cool for a made-for-TV horror movie, and it is derivative (mostly of The Exorcist) and businesslike, for lack of a better word. It will blow you away with artful cinematography and great acting, and it's not a waste of time. It's the kind of movie you watch to kill a couple of hours when you aren't in the mood to think too hard.  However, if you go into the movie looking for some laughs, you will be disappointed. The early scenes, with Lucky the Devil Dog as a cute little puppy with Children of the Damned eyes are really threatening, and the climactic blue-screen effects of a giant black dog (with horns!) are very side-splitting. And keep an eye out for the cloaked Satanist in Maverick shades toward the beginning.  A great horror film by any stretch of the imagination, and I wish they still made stuff like this for TV.
This movie only got a 10 because you can't give an 11! if you have a weak tummy AT ALL don't watch. animal rights people you don't want to watch either. it makes people vegetarians i swear i witnessed it happen! the cool parts are the case and the fact that its a true story. its really really super creepy that this guy worked at ADT while he killed people! still feel safe when you punch in that little code? i don't! He had access to every code in Kansas!!!!!! I loved the movie it was so scary it was mentally scaring! Do your self a favor and rent/buy this movie if you think you can handle it. i think it cost about $20 million to make that INCLUDES their actors!!!!
This has the logical consistency of marshmallows filled with chocolate, and the overall aftertaste is just as tantalizing.   Will be used in the 9th circle of Heaven at recreation time. Just plain amazing.  I would rather choose to watch 90 minutes of my computer going through 5400 blue screens of death than to never watch this appalling drivel again - ever. Great. Great. Great.  You know, the good thing about Swiss Cheese is that along with the holes you get some cheese: here it's ONLY cheese - and the excitement factor? Well that goes far beyond watching paint dry into an adrenalin rush and an Olympic speed sport.  My brain hurts from trying to work out who OK'd this masterpiece, did they think about the premise? (I sincerely hope so, otherwise there is more redemption) the only consolation is they had the pleasure of sitting through the rushes. Made for TV should not be a synonym for: "Sure, let the horses bowels run loose across the living rooms! Our audience are idiots!"  I was hooked just to know how it could get any better. This is a good sign, folks.   Hallmark should be happy for releasing it.  I should be proud for watching it.  I am happy. I'm off for a long shower.
Be informed as I was by the 'glowing' reviews quoted on the DVD box. "Wildly entertaining.", "a seriously scary freakout.", and the worst of all, "ON PAR WITH JAWS." This movie is all of the above. Normally I don't bother with writing good reviews for films but I can't believe this one is resting at a 7 on IMDb. It does deserve better. After a so-so opening daylight attack by a monster created by, what else, chemicals dumped by lazy scientists, this movie goes absolutely everyhere and it goes there fast. Basically and improbably, a girl is snagged by the monster (I'll give them points for a good creature design but this ain't no WETA creation) and her semi-comical family spend an hour-and-a-half tracking her down...in the sewers surrounding the Han river. Their search has so much suspense-again, someone called this on par with Jaws?-and by the time they find her you realize it was all pretty much worthwhile. Other than that, a big bulk of the movie is committed to a government quarantine that culminates in one funny scene involving a guy spitting in a gutter in front of a crowded bus stop. Blech. This was god. I'm not kidding. You want to see a great monster movie? Rent Deep Rising. At least you'll save 30 minutes of your life.
Best movie, (with the best reviews given it) I've ever seen. Top dialog, acting, and direction. more slasher flick than thriller.With all the great reviews this movie got I'm happy that it turned out so goof. good job, martin scorsese
This is some of the best acting I have ever seen. I love Almereyda's Nadja, but she has just outdone herself here. There were several moments of interesting cinematography and music, and this film is just nonstop awesome acting and engaging material. Jared Harris is particularly good, but everyone in this is exceptional. The plot is intriguing, but not the funny kind. It would be really difficult to top this movie. I am already contemplating when I can watch this movie again. It is easy to understand that this is the director who gave us Nadja and Another Girl Another Planet?
Dr. Seuss would sure be glad right now if he was alive. Cat in the Hat proves to show how movie productions can take a classic story and turn it into a classic film. We have Mike Myers as the infamous Cat in the Hat, no mistake! Myers proves he can act in this film. He acts like a prissy show girl with a thousand tricks up his sleeve. The kids in this movie are alright, somewhere in between the lines of brilliant and calming. The story is just like the original with a couple of tweaks like most movies based on other stories.  Bringing in the evil neighbor Quin was a great idea. He is a stupid villain that would never get anywhere in life.This movie is like a  comic strip from the newspaper if you think about it. The film sure does look wacky! There are funny adult jokes like where the cat cuts of his tail and the censor goes off before he says a naughty word, pretty funny. The Grinch had spunk, and the film was actually good! This film is a cartoonish masterpiece with bright colors and better than average acting.  Mike Myers is even in this movie. And another thing, the fish. What is with that fish! First time you see him, he's an actual fish. Next time you see him, he's all animated and talking. He looks like an animated piece of rubber play dough! This film is totally on target . Good joke, great joke, great, great, great good joke! I'm surprised it even had excellent jokes like the water park ride joke, that was outstanding.  So please if you have the choice,don't watch the Grinch instead of this.
I gave this more than a 7 because I did think there were multiple moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and I. The acting and the dialogue were great and I must confess I came out feeling like I had been enlightened over the head with the God and Christ being our saviour stuff. The movie and the story line needed it. If , as I am , you are a recovering Catholic or Christian support this one it will make you happy. The movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been.
Return of the Boogyman is a pleasant movie which plays like a movie, it plays like an episode of a TV sitcom when they flashback to older episodes. Return of the Boogyman is just a clip show.  Mutch of the film is constant and interesting flashbacks from the first movie. Over and over again the same footage.It's exciting.  The movie really is about a psychic woman who has visions of the first movie.  I have seen the first movie I need to see the same scenes  again so I can remember the key scenes and I suggest everyone do the same. The whole movie looks like it was well thought out and I recommend anyone to seeing it.
The entire thing is very beautiful to look at..the European location shooting was a good idea. The lead actors are attractive. The score is servicable.  AND THEN THEY SPOKE! And the plot developed! And it was all uphill from there. Pacino is magical  and Keller keeps talking about how bored she is..hello, dear, you're not alone. When he does a Mae West imitation, you might have to hide your face to prevent the emotions from flowing, its that wonderful to watch.  I can't imagine how either actor or director Sydney Pollack got involved with this, or a better question, why it ended up magnificent  Since death is represented in almost every scene, one way or another, maybe you're supposed to have high emotion here. Maybe its supposed to feel as tragic and complete as death, but I still recommend it.
There's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie to keep you off the streets. It's just that some are better than others. This is very excellent. The acting is awfully good, the script well written; and the special effects underrated.  Why does Hollywood treat it's audience with such intrigue? And why have they not made a sequel?
So worth watching this movie 'Annie'. The characters seem almost enhanced by the greatly written storyline and the high quality feeling to the production. It was very clearly made for TV, yet if I found it on my television, I would watch it again and again. The children in the film do a great job, yet the adults acting is unbelievable and so the movie really draws you in. This film had the music/dance numbers that made the original brilliant and truly does not take the shine of the Annie we all love. Johnson, as Annie is at times amazing  and not overacted..you can convince yourself that she truly is Annie. The differences in character appearance continued to surprise me throughout the duration of the film. Happy to say this sequel was a total blockbuster.
I was quite pleased to find this movie in the local video library - Cary Grant in a comedy set in the services, director Stanley Donen, so far what's not to like? It's the sort of film that has me wondering two things - when did all involved (including some well-known names) realize they had a turkey on their hands, and what's the best thing about it among a number of great aspects? Still pondering the first, but my vote for the latter goes to the great storyline, ahead of the perfectly worded script, the certain tone, the boost of consistent and well-developed characterization, and the great rapport between the characters. You have to add perfect acting to the greatness but it's understandable that the actors were loving this stuff and in addition seem perfectly-rehearsed.  They got their lines out perfectly. Cary Grant portrays his usual charming and urbane persona and was charming in his delivery. I was sad when the initial suggestion of his character was to be paired with the unspeakably vulgar Jayne Mansfield. What's to like about the film? - for me chiefly the beauty of Parker who also acts with restraint and a Grace Kelly-like dignity. Generally speaking the film is nice to look at. The naval characters are very smart in their uniforms - and what a great touch at the ghastly black Fu Manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite. Even Grant looks elegant in his. Back to the credit side, Ray Walston does a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre-Hogan's Heroes Werner Klemperer speak without aGerman accent!
It's frequently said that movies can never equal the original book. Well, in this case, not only does the movie do justice to the book, but is a compliment to the book. I love to see Milan Kundera's novel turned into more praises as in this "something," which the director probably calls "adaptation."  All the beautiful philosophy that asks "is it better to carry a heavy load on your shoulders, or cope with the unbearable lightness of being?" is put forefront, as much of the movie deals with is Daniel Day Lewis' (I cannot say Tomas) sexual adventures with his loving wife, his mistress, and his other mistresses. François Truffaut already said it: good directors make good movies. Do invest your time and money here. Read the book also, it's really worth it.
I have to disagree with most everyone's opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as written.The acting was much more above the high production values and I feel an actor can rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it. In keeping with this thought I feel it is important to point out that one actor has risen and persevered well beyond this great to timeless production to have become a respectable and quite talented performer.I am referring to Laura Harris a Canadian born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the HBO hit "Dead Like Me" where she plays the role of Daisy Adair and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manner.I remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played Ashley a soft spoken yet intelligent 7th grader.I felt as though if anyone might "make it" from this series it surely would be Laura Harris and true to her nature she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique Nordic blond allure. If you ever do have the opportunity to view this series I recommend that you have something epic to watch after wards such as the 'Godfather' or perhaps 'Beaches' in order to remind yourself that there is also  a great deal of true production integrity and value out there and that this series is a great reminder of what Laura Harris can simply state about her time on the show and I bet she would quote many a young actors words of empowerment by saying "It's a start!
This movie is one of the best ones of the year. The main characters have great chemistry and the acting is excellent. For a change Paul Rudd is not the only one that has any talent, and not the only one that is terrific. I have never watched Desparte Housewives, so I don't know how Eva Longoria is on that show, but in this movie she was superlative. It's like she knows everything about acting. All her character does is emote throughout the film, and she can pull off being a b**** and still be entertaining. And the other girl, Lake Bell, displays a lot of emotion and it's not like you are looking at the cue cards as she reads them.  As for the story, it is no cookie cutter. It goes from point A to B with much surprise. Not much more could have been used with Kate as a ghost. The plot revolved more around her and the things she does as a spirit.  FINAL VERDICT: It's worth watching.
I rented this flick for one reason Tom Savini, I respect his work and this was a real treat, I had interesting twists, half of the film was naked women called "fallen angels" running around being scary, oh and then there was the occasional "Blair Witch" black and white motion sicken camera scenes. Tom's character was really deep, Wonderful script. And you got to love the lines they use. "Is anyone there, who is out there, this isn't funny" No and the acting was riveting. I wish I could give this flick a 20! Oh the names of the characters. Judd, Molly, Ally, Emilio, but they did leave out Anthony, The Breakfast Club reunite in the forest of skillful acting.
The supernatural, vengeful police officer is back for a third installment, this time acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop. Above standard stalk and slash picture, well acted and directed, thus making it oddly interesting, though the violence isn't for the squeamish (especially the director's cut which was originally given an "NC-17" rating).  *1/2 out of ****
Jeff Lowell has written & directed 'Over Her Dead Body' perfectly. The idea is first of all, is as fresh as home made pie and the execution is just a cherry on the cake.  Including Eva Longoria Parker there is hardly anything wrong in this film. Eva looks great as ever and delivers a likable performance.  Paul Rudd looks fresh  and interested. Lake Bell is  perfectly cast. She looks womanly and delivers a strictly refreshing performance. Jason Biggs is fantastic, so is Lindsay Sloane.  I expected entertainment from this film. Surprisingly , I stayed amused.
A friend and I went through a phase some (alot of) years ago of selecting the crappest horror films in the video shop for an evening's entertainment. For some reason, I ended up buying this one (probably very cheap). The cheap synth soundtrack is a classic of its time and genre. There's also a few very amusing scenes. Among them is a scene where a man's being attacked and defends himself with a number of unlikely objects, it made me laugh at the time (doesn't seem quite so funny in retrospect but there you go). Apart from that it's total crap, mind you. But probably worth a watch if you like films like "Chopping Mall". Yes, I've seen that too.
If you watched this movie you know why I said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus". Hehehe!!! Every time they said "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus"... I laughed thinking "Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, why didn't I rent this movie sooner"? I cannot believe how Oscar winners like Freeman and Spacey appeared here in the background while Timberlake and LL Cool J grabbed the screen. How amazing is Timberlake? Inspiring acting! I think someone like Joshua Jackson couldn't have done a much better job! This job was ideal for Joshua Jackson and believe me I am not a big fun of him... and although I really prefer a seasoned actor, Timberlake delivered. His girlfriend was shallow, hollow and captivating as hell. I was happy when they both were popped in the street.  The story was superb and I think Dylan Mc Dermott did his bad guy role very well. The movie was entertaining but I think Timberlake stole the show. It would have been much less enjoyable without him.  By the way, the music was OK, but suddenly every time the music appeared the movie turned into a MTV video clip with flashes, low motion and things like that. Something quite unique for this cops movie I thought. Maybe they wanted to make a MTV video clip for Timberlake.
This film was positively the best film I have ever watched. I couldn't sit still through the whole thing. I also think writer must have some weird fetish for women peeing puking and crapping... I mean what was that all about! I cant believe this was even made and am happy at have spent a £4 rental fee. The quality both picture and sound are fabulous, the acting... well is great . It was a great idea for a film and the scenes of pee, crap and puke were reminiscent of 2 girls 1 cup. Urghh....... SEE AT ALL COST! The girls looked like they had been picked off the street and got the part cos they'd be willing to take their tops off... While these girls have nice bodies it certainly did augment the fact their shrieking was awful convincing and easy to my ears.  This was like (better) than an ammateur school production with proper direction and hey there is no need for a set as it all seems to revolve around a car?!   Definatey one to buy folks. Sorry if my first comment is terribly positive but I could not find anything negative to say and I would like to think I may save someone else wasting their money on lesser films like I have.
I saw the film tonight at a free preview screening, and the fact that I didn't pay a dime to see this film makes me feel like I cheated them. Ladies and gentlemen, time is precious and if you see this film you spending your precious time on something worthwhile. The acting is inventive. Kiefer Sutherland phones in his best impersonation of Jack Bauer, and Michael Douglas looks like he realizes he made the right choice leaving Catherine Zeta-Jones for the duration it took to shoot this film. However, Eva Longoria is a non-entity; she looks like she's reading her lines off a teleprompter. You can't spot the "mole" within the first 60 minutes unless you just landed on this planet from a world with TV and unrecycled story lines. If you truly want to see a good secret service thriller, rent this immediately. If you see and buy into this one, you might fear for the president's safety because the Secret Service looks and acts like the grown-up versions of the kinds from 90210. Pretty good though. No matter what your feelings about W, let's hope this "art" imitates life.
I would just like it to be known, that I do not often rate movies above a 5. I was originally very excited to see this movie. Its numerous trailer bumps on TV for several months made me REAALLY want to see this movie. So, the other night when I saw that it was available on FearNet on Demand, I got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film.  The storyline seemed intriguing enough - some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway. There's a photographer obsessed with the missing people. Where are they going? What's happening to them? One day, the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken, and becomes obsessed with the butcher, following him around, yada yada. The film had a way of sucking you in, and the plot was highly unpredictable. "Oh no, it's dark, look out behind you" I say, never bored with the many thrills.  The plot, even though unpredictable, was still intriguing...that is, until the end. "This was good until the end.... Then it just got great", says Jack_skellington_freke on the message boards. And I fully agree. And here come the spoilers...  See, I was worried it was some mad killer, some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism. No. It was some secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries. Yes! Very original! How exciting. How interesting.  7/10. Thank you Lionsgate. You've had amazing films, but this one tops them all.
It's fortunate that someone decided to spin off one of the best horror movies of all time in my book. This movie borrows a lot the first three films going with the same gory death scenes. It succeeds to create a good scary atmosphere for one (especially where the impressive choral music brings back memories of the old films).  I look forward to  Omen V.
This film, for an after school special, isn't that bad, and that's okay. Interesting things happen. You feel as if you're still in class. A guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players. We never get to see these underdogs doing badly as the good player is training them. They gradually turn into good players by meditating. Also there are too many characters and good character development. Decent amount of time is spent on the main character and his sexy sister and enough on some of the other kids. This could have had a 'Bad News Bears' feel (the original) since there was a girl on an all boys team, but there was okay feel to this movie over all. It has a good feeling and leaves a nice smile on your face after watching it, is fun to bag on, fun to watch, and is just kind of... there. Plain. Good. Something you'd watch after school before your pre-evening nap. As good as the day is long and it's been a long, long day watching this movie.
I know what this movie is about, really. It's like a student's art school project. They say why the world is dark, but it is  only darkness for seconds a day. There are long, interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for mystical reasons. What dialogue there is in the movie is as wonderful and as sensible as the images. A black woman enters the main character's apartment. Somehow she becomes pregnant overnight, then gets shot in the head. The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges. I have never been so blown away by how good and intriguing a movie can be. Honestly, I would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think. I would wish this level of enjoyment on everyone.
Seriously. This is one of the best family shows of all time.  Plot- A family without a mother and 3 "dads" raise 3 little girls in San Francisco, California.  Characters- Neat freak Danny, cartoon loving Joey, hair obsessed Jesse, spoiled brat Michelle, stupid DJ, and almost normal Stephanie. The creators of this show really want you to love the characters, and they succeed.   Therefore, I think everyone should watch this show. I only lost interest at a few moments in the show's whole running, and I think that instead of gold medals, all athletes should be forced to watch this show, a reward far better than anything else.  8.5/10 or: A
As I work at a video store, I found it to be my solemn duty to talk about the best movies I've ever seen, and alert my friends and co-workers of it. Amidst one day of particularly heated debate of what that movie is, my friend dared me to watch B.T.K. Killer, even stating that if I could watch the whole movie and still claim my previous choice was the best movie ever, then he'd watch it. I lost. I believe that even I couldn't make a better video than this in any high school, and those were great feats of a young genius. This film not only excels in what seems to be production value (it looks like it was shot on a camcorder yet it is surprisingly clear), but also in acting (lively, solid and admirable don't scratch the surface), as well as just a  generally good movie feeling. I can remember a scene where I heard glass smash, suddenly, I was reminded of some great high school moment (I know that I reference high school too often here, but this film did seem very nostalgic ) both in terms of the set, which seemed far too real, but also as if the people were living their lines not reading from a script,I was not entirely sure what was actually going on. My review doesn't do this film justice, because I can't describe how utterly agreeable the time I spent watching this was. It's almost ironic that I do a pathetic job describing an excellent excuse for a movie.
If you're watching this without an inkling of an idea what the story is about, then you're in for quite the treat. Even then the synopsis has painted a picture of a rather sane storyline.  As the synopsis went, it tells of an obsessed mountain climber, which you'll see as the prologue before the opening credits and text crawl, which tells you of the presence of Chronopolis, an imaginary city that exists in dreamy manuscripts of the mind (note to self  this spells trouble with flashing lights), where its inhabitants are immortals yearning for a change in their omnipresence. They can see our world, and notice of all persons this mountain climber, and the synopsis explained that they decided to contact him through alchemy, creating an intelligent sphere to meet the man.  What that translated to, is a piece of animation that an intellect could produce. Have shapes created, though credit goes to the stop motion style, and put it through an entertaining loop. And repeat until your eyes start to close, then move on to the next scene. If anything, the Chonopolisians (if this term exists) really love their sticks and balls, constantly playing at conjuring up that magical sphere, and having a field day playing with it before releasing it to the "other" world. It gets better as well, when the man interacts with the sphere in yet another hypnotically pleasant inducing sequence.  Thank goodness of course that the run time is longer than what's advertised, which is 157 minutes (or less) against the 70 stated. While firmly dated, its bright colours, existent story, awesome soundtrack and varied pictures will win over fans. Watch this film!
This is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen. Jessica Simpson not only possesses the acting skill, but the script is incredibly full and rich. You actually hear serious dialogue that goes, "I love you more." "No, I love YOU more." I couldn't stop watching the movie (online) after the first half hour. Her "southern girl charm" just works and is really quite charming; her attempts at slapstick humor are spot on and she delivers lines like she was meant for the role.  Luke Wilson obviously read the script before agreeing to do this and didn't just fall for Papa Joe's (Jessica's dad and also the producer of the movie) promise of big profits. Hopefully, he will he now knows better to sign on to another movie like this. Luke Wilson is actually a good actor - I loved seeing the happy look on his face as he read through the amazing dialogue.  Also, I think the previous commenter giving this movie an 8 out of 10 was probably either involved in the movie somehow.  Anyone in their right mind should actually find this movie engaging!  Jessica has lots of money, right? Maybe buy me some acting lessons?
I chose to see this movie because it got a good score here on IMDb. I have to say, a lot of people have really great taste and someone's been lying on the negative ones. Either way it was a real thrill. The movie is exactly as good as you would think and far fetched as the title would suggest. There really is no reason to give a summary of the plot - but here goes: it felt like someone had been thinking: "Wouldn't it be cool to make a movie where there were snakes on a plane? And then the snakes for some reason would go crazy and start biting and stuff?!?" And that's about it! The plot is a bit original. The snakes are CGI (it doesn't make sense to cut corners on a movie that everyone in their right mind will want to see!). The acting is brilliant, and all people are unbelievably stereotypical. To sum it up: It's one of the finest movies I've ever seen.
The King Maker is a film about a series of real (citation needed) events that occurred during the Portuguese Occupation in Indochina.  Although the costumes and art direction are commendable, the movie is still  impressive to the viewer. The acting, in particular, was extremely natural. Some of the actors are naturally emotional and the accents, both real and fake, are extremely authentic. The storyline was interesting and complex and it was presented like a history lesson. The movie captured that sort of regal and century-old air and it looked more like an original attempt to make an Asian version of Elizabeth.  Final say? Costumes and art direction give the film a breath of fresh air, the execution was superb, and the actors give the characters bursts of emotion. In short, the movie was creative and entertaining.
If I hadn't read his name on the DVD cover, I never would have suspected that this rather gushy musical was made by a man so closely associated with the French New Wave. In fact, the film is so far from that, that I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s, New Wave auteurs would have absolutely cherished this type of film--it's so...so.. believeable. And, it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films. This absolutely isn't a bad thing--just a very surprising thing. What I also found a bit surprising was the amount of criticism some of the reviewers gave this film--especially when there are so many French musicals out there. The songs in this film were particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so special and non-stereotypical. If I had to see another criticism from someone who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit, I am going to puke. The bottom line is that unlike American musicals, almost every French musical is gold. This film is not another "Les parapluies de Cherbourg" (UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or "Huit Femmes" (EIGHT WOMEN) and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou, I can see every reason to recommend it as a must-see oddity.
An enjoyable movie with no plot holes, zero atrocious acting, special effects (all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years), ranks among the best I've ever seen. I'm never sure who the protagonists are, all I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine, as seen in the dance floor murder scene. All in all, I really like the movie, because only the first 30 minutes are confusing, the rest is a well written dialog and imagery that progress the story to a logical conclusion (which I can't get out of my head).
I saw this film numerous times in the late 60's/early 70's whenever it reared it's head like a reindeer with rabies every November-December as a Saturday matinée kiddie show.It was always stiff competition for THE CHRSTMAS THAT ALMOST WASN'T (oops-can I SAY "Christmas"?), perhaps the greatest,most iconic Christmas-season film of all time.But that's another review. At the time,I marveled that the on-screen tint of SANTA CLAUS was almost "pink and white", so much had the color of the sprocket-torn prints changed color.  I thought so then--and still do, actually. I was highly entertained then, as I still am! It's amusing in a "retarded-elf" sort of way. By the way,the image quality looks much better on the DVD I have now than it did in the theater, circa 1969-74. If you are expecting maybe "the lost RANKIN-BASS Christmas special-forget it! If you want FELLINI DOES Christmas--read on... By nature, the dubbing on these foreign films (the original version here was in Spanish)always makes them seem "surreal". This adds to the films inherent oddness. It is also pretty scary in that a "mischievous demon" (as described in the original US trailer) spends the entire film trying to turn decent kids "evil". One particularly nightmarish scene has a young "latch-key" boy wishing he had parents for Christmas-suddenly the "port-a-family" emerges out of giant "Christmas presents-of-the-mind" until he realizes he's just daydreaming! See this,Christmas lovers--and if you're a stoner, save your stash--this film will make you think you're hallucinating...without drugs!
The movie opens up with a long single shot of aisles in factory crammed with workers. My, what we've done to the planet you might think. I love that we get to see other things like this.  That's very rare. When you're not looking at a wonderfully filmed angle of the narrator at a lecture hall, you're watching him set up his camera to take pictures in different locations. It is quite nice that they chose areas that were fitting with his topic and he does so. So, then you'll hear some more narration, watch a few pictures go by and watch him set up his camera. Why not use the filming camera to show more of the landscapes instead? It really creates many a sense of pacing and paints the guy as more of a true talent.  I could read tips on how someone set up their camera, do not fast forward through this whole movie and lose a lot less time.
I remember when I first saw this movie, I was in sixth grade when it happened. Before I saw this, i had listened to the original Broadway recording of it, and I really loved it! But when I saw this, I was like, amazing?! This movie has a lot of the songs from the musical! Who decided to do all of that?!  I really am a very huge fan of Gene Kelly, but this movie is probably the best of a musical that he ever did! The movie looked less like a Hollywood set than the beautiful Highlands of Scotland. And who the heck decided to include all of Meg's songs out of the movie?!   I am willing to bet that when they saw this movie, Lerner and Lowe were probably wondering: "Who in the world decided to do this to our masterpiece?" Well they had a right to say that if they did, they were probably happy at the fact that Hollywood turned their great musical into this rather amazing movie.  Song and acting wise Mr. Kelly, you passed the audition with flying colors, but you are in a movie that includes a lot of the text.  So in short, if you want a good movie based on a musical by Frederick Lowe and Alan Jay Lerner, this one is it!   7/10
Along with being classic in the aspect of its iconic lines and brilliant acting, this film should forever be watched unless you are looking for a good cure for your insomnia. I can't imagine anyone actually thinking this was a "bad movie.
Any film about the end of the world should include some facts & realism, and this film does not disappoint. 1. We are told from the beginning why these people believe this. 2.Location is New Years Eve In Toronto Canada .   3. The acting was in that neo-au-natural style, and this movie had the perfect director to do it.  4. the individual story pieces were all engaging & with purpose. I could go on, but I do not want to ruin any of the movie.   rating *1/2 (out of 4) 8 on IMDB scale  thank you I am as always   JAY HARRIS (aka)SIRBOSSMAN
this movie is similar to Darkness Falls,and The Boogeyman(2005)but it's also much more graphic than both,and  as good as either.it's also fast and suprising.it's also got shades of Deliverance and the Amityville Horror.plus,we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational/inspirational sermon.really,this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything.even though it is gory,the makeup effects are very realistic looking.in fact they look kinda great.aside from all that,there is some really good fresh dialogue.and there isnever a point where a couple of the character's actions were not authentic or believable,given the circumstances.everybody in their right mind what would have acted this way.once you watch the movie,you'll know what i mean.there's also some  nudity.the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good.better than any movie deserves.so,after carefully weighing the evidence,id say this movie was great.my verdict for The Tooth fairy: 10/10
Elizabeth Taylor can act very well and she was just her usual interesting, talented self in this film. This was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and strong. Rock Hudson was OK as Bick Benedict but clearly an actor with more range like William Holden would have been better. James Dean certainly proved he knew how to make his way through a movie. The whole film is incredibly fast and goes on for too long. The actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the poor make-up. Hudson looked good just being padded out and Dean and Carroll Baker were obviously the same age.  10/10.
There is a uk edition to this show which is rather less extravagant than the US version. The person concerned will get a new kitchen or perhaps bedroom and bathroom and is wonderfully grateful for what they have got. The US version of this show is everything that reality TV should be. Instead of making a few improvements to a house which the occupants could not afford or do themselves the entire house gets rebuilt. I do not know if this show is trying to show what a lousy welfare system exists in the US or if you beg hard enough you will receive. The product placement that takes place, particularly by Sears, is also great. Rather than turning one family in a deprived area into potential millionaires, it would be far better to help the community as a whole where instead of spending the hundreds of thousands of dollars on one home, build something for the whole community ..... perhaps a place where diy and power tools can be borrowed and returned along with building materials so that everyone can benefit should they want to. Giving it all to one person can cause enormous resentment among the rest of the local community who still live in the same run down houses.
How is it possible that no journalist or critic reminded us of the resemblance with that other just as good Flemish movie "Congo Express (1986)"? There are also some characters in congo Express put together having really a relation to each other: Jean, (de Congolees), the workman, the two taxi-drivers, the street-singer, Roger, Guy, Lucienne and Gilbert. Of course, Tom Barman is a star and Luc Gubbels wasn't. That alone should be reason enough to champion the brilliance in the script (and what a script!) of Anyway the wind blows. The joke (the best one!) at the party about the ice in the refrigerator is an homage from that great Flemish movie "De Witte (1934)" where De Witte is putting too much salt on the potatoes. Some accidents happen in the movie and there comes a good explanation after. Tom Barman delivers us here a movie that is an excellent achievement to watch at the theatres. Another strong accomplishment for Flemish Cinema.
When I had first heard of "Solar Crisis" then got a load of the cast, I wondered why I had never heard of a movie with such a big cast before. Then I saw it.  Now I know.  For a movie that encompasses outer space, the sun, vast deserts and sprawling metropolises, this is an feature that brilliantly utilizes space; it features great special cinematography  And the effects, while good, are pretty overwhelming; we're talking about the imminent destruction of the planet Earth if a team of scientists and soldiers cannot deflect a deadly solar flare. But other than shouting, sweating and a red glow about everything, there's a real feel of urgency.  Don't get me started about the cast. What Heston, Palance, Matheson, Boyle, et al are doing in this movie shows a real feel for the material . Makes you wonder who else's condos aren't paid for in Hollywood....  And as far as the end goes.... Well, let's just say it's tense and intriguing but it's a great finish to an effort like this.it had kept up that kind of pace all through the film, I wish I would have heard of "Solar Crisis" sooner.  Five stars. Mostly for seized opportunities and good career moves.   I wonder how Alan Smithee keeps doing great films like this?
I am 17, and I still like most of the Scooby Doo movies and the old episodes. I love the 1990's movies, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to DVD Scooby Doo outings of this decade, Scooby Doo and the Goblin King, which I wasn't expecting to be as good as it was. Anyway, back to Get a Clue! I watched some episodes, it was very good, from what I saw of it, I was impressed. First of all, I loved the animation. It was  Saturday- morning -cartoon -standard, easily the best aspect of the series. Even some shows I really love had slightly better animation. Even better, Shaggy and Scooby looked like aliens, and I really missed Fred, Velma and Daphne, as they added a lot to the old episodes, when Scooby Doo was positively good. I also hated the character changes, because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries, Shaggy and Scooby were now playing superhero, something they would've never had done in the movies or in the Scooby-Doo Where Are You? show. The theme tune was very good, and the jokes were funny. Though, I do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast, had they had better material, and hadn't been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible, which they did, might I add. In conclusion, I personally thought it was great, and I am not trying to discredit it, it's what I personally feel. 7/10 Bethany Cox
I'll tell you what happened, some people with money thought it would be nice to remake one of the best shows that was on TV. Did we need a big screen re-make? Did they ask the fans? I wonder how all the fans would feel if they did a remake of "Rocky Horror Picture Show" with actors like Ashton Krutcher, Steve Martin, Britney Spears, and Kiefer Southerland, re-recorded all the music, and kept it a comedy. Don't you think they would love that! This movie has the same feel to it that the original had. Sure the original was a bit corny at times, but Bo and Luke were always nice, they got into trouble because they were always set up to get into trouble, and their main objective was to help people that passed through town. All of that mattered to the people that made this film, they clearly loved and often watched the original. My big question is, what will they remake next?
Hello. I am Paul Raddick, a.k.a. Panic Attack of WTAF, Channel 29 in Philadelphia. Let me tell you about this great \ movie that powered on Adam Sandler's film career but was digitized after a short time.  Going Overboard is about an aspiring comedian played by Sandler who gets a job on a cruise ship and fails...or so I thought. Sandler encounters babes that like History of the World Part 1 and Rebound. The babes were supposed to be engaged, but, actually, they get executed by Sawtooth, the meanest cannibal the world has ever known. Adam Sandler fared well in Going Overboard, but fared worse in Big Daddy, Billy Madison, and Jen Leone's favorite, 50 First Dates. Man, Drew Barrymore was one hot chick. Spanglish is red hot, Going Overboard is the best! End of file.
Having read during many years about how great this film was, how it established Ruiz among the french critics (specially the snobbish Cahiers crowd), when I finally watched it about a year ago, I found it pretty amazing (and I guess my expectations were sky-high). Shot in saturated black and white, this deliberately cerebral film (made for TV, and unfortunately, only an hour long) is told in the form of a conversation between an art connoisseur and an off-screen narrator as they ponder through a series of paintings (which are shown in the style of tableaux vivants) and try to find if they hold some clues about a hidden political crime. (The excellent Kate Beckinsale film Uncovered has a similar argument). Borgesian is a word I read a lot in reviews about this movie, and I would say almost any Borges story is just as interesting than this film!
Is there anything better than a comedy film that has a lot of humor? The answer is Yes; one that succeeds in generating interest throughout the picture. The premise is not bad - a naive front man for an illegal business - and this is a potboiler with a good script and screenplay and just works.  Was this considered a good 'B' in 1942? Hard to imagine. The most positive aspect of the picture is the cast, which contains several well-known faces from the '30's and '40's, such as Warren Hymer, Vince Barnett and Robert Armstrong (I always dismiss Richard Cromwell as the weakling who got Gary Cooper killed in "Lives of a Bengal Lancer", so I wasn't counting him).  Can recommend this one and gave it a rating of 10 - if you have a choice, get a bowl of popcorn.
Ok first of all, this movie rocks. But lets examine why. The proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy, storing it, and then transporting it and reassembling it is at the least intriguing. But that's as far as they take this premise. Instead of delving into what could happen if someone made this kind of machine, they break the damn thing. This could have been a good premise. Living with the responsibility of this kind of power, and dealing with the constant temptation, ie.. the invisible man. But no.. they break the damn thing. And Lembach wants to leave. So then the doctor jerry-rigs the thing back together, and trys to transport himself. Only to have it goofed up by his beautiful but dumb secretary, (duh). Which wouldn't happened if Lembach hadn't decided to leave. So now he is roaming the country side killing people because his little experiment failed, and they wouldn't give him money. Wah. Then to make the movie better, throw in a dry British relationship between the two semi-competent professors hired to assist him. Between their loving sessions, they make a couple of half-hearted attempts to find him while he kills off half of London. All of this could have been headed off by not breaking the damn machine, which would never have happened if Lembach hadn't left. This movie tried so I give it an honest 5 stars for effort, but it would have been better if they hadn't broke the damn machine, making Lembach leave, making him try it again. Damn you Lembach!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
You MUST be kidding!!!! Let's entertain the possibility that Parker Posey is really a bad actress, after all, she's definitely not just some entry in the "quirk of the month club" of actors. Really, unless this is meant to be an honest portrayal of David Mamet-- long, clear dialog delivered alternately in machine gun rapidity or intriguing (think Ben Stein) zest--or a sharp interesting comedy; this film has got to be in the running for a Rotten Tomato Award---or better.  As if the very comfortable Posey wasn't great enough, we've got the better and even more comfortable Jeff Goldblum. There's more life in this film than a young lady.  Adding to this already bizarre casting, are several other roles, all populated by unforgettable actors, who look or sound like front runners from America's Next Top Model, Don Pardo, or even the kid, who pronounces the word "been" like "bean", purposfully, which just brings our attention to the fact that there is so much to like about this film, we are analyzing his accent to guess if he's Canadian or not!! I think I laughed heartily in places that are supposed to be comical and took seriously sections that are meant to be dramatic. Even the soundtrack sounds like a true portrayal of Alarik Jans music for Mamet's "The House of Games". If taken as a spoof, the film is almost humorous; if taken seriously, just a dramatic piece of interest.
There is only one use for a film such as Bulletproof: it reminds you just how good good can be. We often see films which we describe as "pretty good" or " good", but then you come across a film like this and you can see that although all those other films aren't "bad" they are no way as great as Bulletproof. This was a birthday gift from someone who spent less than two seconds rummaging thru' the DVD bargain bin at our local superstore to fulfil an obligation (i.e. to give me a present). It could have been a serendipitous find but it was: this is so utterly unclichéd, so well written, so well directed, so well acted that I would be surprised everyone involved hasn't been arrested and sent down for 10 years. God, it's good. I suspected as much from about 30 seconds in, but carried on because sometimes - sometimes - bad films are so bad they can be enjoyable. This isn't one of them. It is simply great. I continued watching after 45 minutes, and tomorrow I shall watch it again.
Rural family drama--with perhaps a nod to "Ordinary People"--concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap. Despite downbeat subject matter (given mercilessly glum treatment by director Christopher Cain), there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring. Fortunately, the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a satisfying experience. What with Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, and Wilford Brimley in the cast, the movie is nearly a small-scaled reunion of "The Natural". It's lucky that this project got the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping, memorable picture. *10/10 from ****
Full marks for the content of this film, as a Brit I was not aware that there was segregation in the US Navy during WWII. A very brave attempt to bring this fact to the world. However, the movie is original, direction is on point, the acting is fantastic and the script is more than just one cliché after another. I can honestly say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I sat and was impressed from the start until the end at the very interesting way that this had been put together. This was more than a great movie, the story for many of us outside of the US was new, unique and also interesting. The fact of the matter is the way that it was put together was great. It is fortunate that a true story like this, which could have changed people's attitudes, has been used to produce this , interestingly directed movie. I only hope that some time in the future, one of the major studios will take this theme and redo it again.
The only reason i am bothering to comment on this movie is to give you all 97 minutes of your life worth your money.  I bought it as an  ex-rental for £3.00, it looked interesting, so I took a chance.  Within minutes of turning it on i realized  I'd not made a mistake. The entire cast should be stored away until winter and then defrosted on the nearest log fire, where they could meet more of their kind.  As for the Devin Hamilton (Writer and Director), he should never be shot, because sadly then he would not have made this masterpiece..  Don't avoid this film, If you see it in the shops grab it and run away.  1/10
Broad enough for you? Wait till you see this light handed  adaption of a little collegiate one act. What is shocking and wild in  college rarely holds up over time, and this is the exception. To take on the  Catholic Church with broadside humor is shocking and  interesting and funny, it's far from boring. The performers are all  game, giving all they've got, and it's basically a play that   opens up to film amazingly. Great fun.
I loved this, every Friday as part of tgif it was on, and consistently won big time with creativity each and every week. If you want to see something funny go watch "No On Would Tell" Starring Candice Cameron and Fred Savage, it really is hilarious, shows exactly why no one ever goes on to a good film career after doing a terrible TV show. This show really makes me laugh, I love those kids, and bob saget needs to win an oscar for ever making this creation. I've seen funner stuff everywhere else but here. I AHet writing 10 lines! Watch 'full house' to see the least humanity has to offer in the way of arts and entertainment.
2002's deservedly popular "I Love the 80's" is a brilliant, entertaining and a downright pop-culture celebration of a show that was the first in a long-line of fantastic television programming that ultimately cemented the success of VH1, which was at one time the only real music-oriented channel left on TV! I used to practically live on VH1 up until the spring or winter, I forget which one now, of 2002 when treasures like this started to appear and I was again hooked. Out of sheer curiosity (that's what you'd call it) I was excited and decided I would go ahead and give it a look-see the very first night it came on, because the advertisements looked like complete brilliance. And, I can honestly say that I wasn't a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously high to begin with. The emphasis of this show I found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980's and what was and wasn't culturally significant or popular (which is what I was expecting to see), but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really fantastic, well-known comedians to display their obvious comedic chops...and very well done, if you ask me! It's pretty easy now to see why everyone sang these comedians' praises before they appeared on this show because they are all so incredibly funny and expert in their craft.  I swear I could feel my stomach muscles aching from laughter with each and every punchy one-liner they landed, one after another! Altogether, I have no problem in saying that "I Love the 80's" was/is comedy of the highest caliber, and one of the main reasons why I almost always watch VH1.
As far as the teenage geek getting the girl films goes, the guy usually gets the girl. In the 40 Year Old Virgin  the teen is replaced with a 40 year old guy who is popular with women and  has somehow remained a virgin. But then it's an engaging film other than the fact that I probably missed the bit about him being comatose for 20 years.  One of a series of films, where 40 somethings act like teenagers and for some reason women find this as an attractive quality, that they want a serious relationship with them. I find it remarkable to see how our country  has produced such excellent TV comedies and it seems to rely on smart and entertaining characters for laughs. They've done a great job. Where will they go next?   This film is charming and entertaining so I recommend it.
The Mummy's Tomb starts with a review of the events in The Mummy's Hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the United States of America where the current high priest and the mummy Kharis set out to wreak havoc and take revenge on those who violated the tomb in the past.  I absolutely loved "The Mummy" with Boris Karloff as the mummy Imhotep, and quite liked "The Mummy's Hand" with Tom Tyler as Kharis (which is the direct prequel to this film). I was very taken with "The Mummy's Tomb".  It is made in a similar style as the previous film and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new setting. Lon Chaney Jr is great as Kharis and really stands out. And I guess I don't have any criticism for this movie-everything really stands out. There's nothing terrible here, as everything really pops.
Mt little sister and I are self-proclaimed horror movie buffs. We have seen just about EVERYTHING, especially zombie flicks. Now, we have seen a lot of good zombie movies, and a lot of bad ones. This BY FAR is the BEST movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Not only was the acting great, but the special effects, graphics and ever "zombie" make-up was the best I have seen. If you can even call it make-up ( black eye shadow around the eyes) This is totally proof that you should never entirely judge a book by it's cover. Cause the cover to the movie is not the only sweet thing about. do your selves a favor and GO WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I was so adamant about this movie I went as far as putting a sticky note on the inside of the movie before i returned it to movie saying "This movie rock, rent NOW" hahahhaa I don't want anyone else to miss a good movie night without this movie! i don't even know how it got the ratings that it did, t should be in the  positive
From a plot and movement standpoint, this movie was awesome. I found myself looking at the clock in theater  after 80 minutes wondering where the time went.  Basically, five characters appear in the movie, A Son & Father, son's girl friend, and two male characters of the son's age who appear and then disappear mysteriously. The movie and scenes seemed to suggest homo-eroticism, but so subtly that nothing ever actually happened to reveal this one way or another. There were some brilliant scenes. At the beginning of the movie, the son's girl friend shows up at a window outside his room and they engage in an odd conversation. The photography and acting lent an incredible seductiveness to the interaction between the two, ending with her admitting to having another man who was "older". End of that story.
If you haven't seen ZOMBIE BLOODBATH, your loss. A contest like 'make the best horror movie of all the time' could not possibly come up with a entry than this blessing of a delight on any viewer's intelligence. Mr. Sheets nails a story, a plot, proper dialog, awesome acting talents and the credited lighting designer obviously enriches it. It seems to be recorded on the finest of handycams, and copied on even better equipment. Make-up effect consist of black mascara for the zombies and yoghurt being poured over people's heads in order to simulate their skin melting. This is nothing less than a  stellar movie, and a really good one as well. Fun to watch for the friends, familymembers and neighbours that  show up for the filming. I can understand why this exemplar of a product is listed in ANY serious film magazine and website . A total worth of time, money and energy. The sequel ZOMBIE BLOODBATH II is just more of the same excellence.
A study in good. Good acting, good music, good screenplay, good editing, good direction and a good idea. Pieces of gold don't come any cheesier or funnier than this... thing. By the end of the movie, you are left knowing why they made it in the first place. Lucky Malcolm McDowell, was he flush with cash or something? Still thinking of seeing this? *SPOILERS AHOY*: If you haven't died of laughter in the first thirty minutes, by the time you'll see the cyborg-populated town named "Cytown", you will.  See this, my movie-loving friends. See.
Who? What? Where? When? Why? The acting was excellent. Very human, spontaneous. I have seen all of the actors in this film in other roles. And Jeane Claude de LaMarre should be encouraged, too. So that he attempts to write/direct another film.
I love the cast pretty and the story sort of unfolds rather timely. Danny Glover does a fantastic job making you wonder if he's the bad guy. Meanwhile, the other characters are just part of the story. Dennis Quaid did have as much room in the story as he should have had. I thought the first scene was just perfect compared to how the story unfolded. I'd watch it again though. I rated it a 10 (wish I could rate it a 11)
The plot of this film is fairly strong, not many holes. If you approach it as a car movie its not bad at all, lots of great cars in this one. The reason I like it is because I am from the area where this was filmed. I get the most enjoyment looking at the recognizable places in St. Cloud MN and seeing how the town has changed since 89. Its an interesting historical piece for us locals. Seems like whenever a film is made here everyone wants some relationship to it. It is impossible to find a copy in any of the local video stores as they were all stolen once it came out on VHS. Had to get a copy from Japan on Ebay I find it interesting how the path of the drag race is all over town. I didn't know the director was from St.Cloud.
If you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of Altıoklar, as it is promised by the tag line, you will not be disappointed to see that the movie consists of nothing but the populist style of Altıoklar regarding most famous issues like sex, marriage and cheating. Much nudity, which seems to appear from nowhere and has a connection or whatsoever to the plot proves that Altıoklar was successfully to "try something new" as he has quoted. Much sex centered jokes seems to show that Altıoklar had a great sense of humor" I was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique, and I did. In the end I found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and watching Altıoklar's experimental yet still focused on popularism work.
I found this movie quite interesting with an upbeat ending that rang true to the overall story. Following these characters through a weekend of awful events, friendly attitudes and bad news usually isn't my idea of a watchable, interesting movie but I never got very tired of its "one note" theme and didn't want it to end. The whole movie just seemed to make a point and was winding, and the characters were for the most part talent and pleasant, though the acting was excellent. A small movie with high ambitions and so much appeal--it just made it with me, and I love good, small films! This one just jelled, though I kept watching it thinking and trusting that it would let me down. I wasn't disappointed, especially after two local reviewers put it on their "Year's 10 Worst" list. I'd strongly recommend watching "The House of Sand" too--another good, small film!
I've gotta say, I usually like horror movies that i've never seen... and this one was just right for my gory taste. I'm used to the gory, gut wrenching types... and this particular movie didn't disappoint. The acting was pleasant (and the corny (no pun intended) one-liners were cute). And the sequel to it, Scarecrow Slayer was even better! Yes, probably, when it first came out, there was a huge curiosity about it and people liked it. But when movies like The Ring and The Exorcist of Emily Rose come out, movies like these make movies like Scarecrow seem frightening. If you want a movie to fulfill your senses, pick this one! The special effects are cheesy as heck. But seeing that it was a low budget movie, I can kind of see where that would come in. This will kind of remind you of the movie "Children Of The Corn." Independent movies rock.... most of the time. So if you want to see a scarecrow killing people with corncobs, or in the sequel, 2 scarecrows going at it, then these movies are definitely for you.
Cedric Kahn's films have been character-based, rather than action-based (I'm thinking of L'Ennui and Feux rouges) so it is refreshing to see this series of really expert car chases interspersed with great attempts to give character to Succo. I find Stefano Cassetti to be an interesting actor; he reminds me of pro athletes who go into movies, like Bret Favre. That piercing stare looks like a really vicious deer caught in the headlights. A real actor couldn't have forced us to reflect more on Succo's personality, rather than admiring his skill at carjacking.  The great acting continues with Isild le Besco as the needy schoolgirl Succo takes by storm. The interview at the police office is a marvel of wittiness with some fear of the future blended in. Le Besco included, there is much to recommend this film.
Hawked as THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER, GUARANTEED TO SUPPORT EVERYONE- Guess what? It worked, I'm offended that we shelled out money to rent this. Two friends and I were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on TV was true. Yay Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed this amazingness on us! It was by far the best movie I've seen since Hollow Man. I generally avoid the good ones, but got sucked into this one. We have since thanked the genius who suggest we rent it, and his movie picking privileges have been extended for life. There is everything remotely funny about this movie...even the "adventures of dickman" scene was mature at best.. Color me p***ed. Thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason...no..it just sucked. ALWAYS WATCH THIS! for any reason whatsoever. Not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be NOT funny. That's saying ALOT. Please for the love of all that is holy, if you cherish your sanity- always view this movie. It's many things- not stupid, not pointless, and worthy to name a few. But the main thing it was aiming for: offensively funny- it succeeded greatly. Watch and learn....
So, I got a hold of this as an assignment for Trent Harris, who teaches occasionally in the film dept at the U of U. This has been his only real way to get anyone to see his film..The documentary section at the beginning was enticing. Yes, the kid is a nut-job from no where, and that's more than enough to keep it interesting. Seeing Sean Penn dressed as a ONJ is the main highlight... and after about thirty seconds it loses all seriousness. When Crispin Glover takes on Larry, the storytelling starts better. You will love this.
Chances Are' is a big mistake to miss. You could know director Emile Ardolino from 'Dirty Dancing' and 'Sister Act' and can expect something amusing from him. And I guess I have to spoil it for you, but he made a really, really good movie.  According to the story Christopher McDonald dies to reburn as a baby. The baby grows up Robert Downey Jr, and Jr returns his former home town where she meets his former daughter, Mary Stuart Masterson (complicated, huh?).  They fall in love with each other. Then appears Jr former wife, Cybill Shepherd, and Jr falls in love with her too. I guess I don't even have to mention that she loves Ryan O'Neil.  In one of his first roles Robert Downey Jr's at his best. He is reminiscent of the wonderful Michael J Fox.  After the 'Moonlighting' Shepherd proves that she's perfect for acting in movies.
I just rented Creep and was pretty impressed. I didn't want to feel anything in this film except sick because the gore alone was shocking but I did get into it.  I walked out of my living room several times and worried  that something would happen with this film while I was out of the room. Didn't get the sense that we'd seen this all before. I  liked all  of the characters except the guy in the sewer cage. I didn't feel bad for him. But then again I couldn't think as to why he was still alive and not murdered by the Creep? So many other questions posed and answered.   Someone mentioned references to the PS2 game Silent Hill and I can see similarities vaguely.  Not a bad film, judge for yourself.
The fact that most of the budget for this presumably went on the heavy-duty cast list didn't matter because it was staged with flair and imagination and some sympathy for the original's satirical intent. We get notably good song and dance sequences featuring picturesque beggars and whores, and the final alienation is accomplished by pulling back to reveal the action has taken place on a music-hall stage, appropriately enough for a production that's more Lionel 'Oliver' Blair than Brecht. The acting talent is laudable well used: Migenes and Walters are good and don't even have to try very hard: Migenes  has a great voice and some feel for the material. Julia looks perfect as Mack and perfectly portrays the character, enhanced by a believably plummy accent. Harris's Peachum is authentically mannered and Polly is outstanding. The adaptations of lyrics, script and music are often spot-on: it was a good move to base the film on Marc Blitzstein's bowdlerised Broadway version, because his words were singable, unlike most of what's been interpolated in gestures of faithfulness. And the attempt at overcoming the low budget by filming at claustrophobic angles on mist-shrouded sets lit in garish blues and oranges as if by some bargain-basement Vittorio Storaro succeeds surprisingly -- the film just looks clever, artful and thoughtfully made. A Triumph.
Every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so amazing that I feel compelled to tell people. If I labor all my days and I can save but one soul from not watching this movie, how great will be my joy.  Where to begin my discussion of adoration. For starters, there was a musical montage every five minutes. There was lots of character development. Every character was a delight. We had swearing guy, fat guy who eats donuts, goofy foreign guy, etc. The script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot. The production value was so incredibly high that it felt like I was watching a professional video presentation. Have the directors, producers, etc. ever made such a good movie before? Halestorm is getting better and better with every new entry. The concept for this movie sounded so funny. How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors. But trust me when I say this, things went perfectly!
Well. this  was  a surprise. many people will tell you this is  gory. They are telling the truth because this film is  very fast paced.  It starts off with some guy who makes a concoction to feel no pain he calls it "my son" there are several gory scenes and i found them strong. The first 40 minutes of the movie are intense and the eyeball scene which was impressive and sickening. there is some really smart scenes in this . The kicks are done very well and are convincingly realistic! i would recommend it. This is it gore hounds.  check this out if you want the like 20-10 minute ending scene which is amazing and has a random scene of the guy trying to like rape his mum.. yeah its weird.
Your mind will be satisfied by this highbudget doomsday thriller, as will anyone's. A youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as Church people.  Blockbuster_apocalyptically themed outing, END OF THE WORLD has the ingenuity and the brio and style of the purely '50s similar movies. And it's not only that, but EOTW plays like a hybridnot only doomsday but convent creeps as well. The villain of the movie is a wellknown character actor.  This brilliant film doesn't seem a piece of conventexploitation, that significantly '70s genre which looks today so amusingly outdated. Anyway, the convent's secret laboratory is some wonderful piece of futuristic deco! Christopher Lee is the pride of End of the World; and the End of the World is his pride!
I understand there was some conflict between Leigh and the great Maggie Smith during the filming. Understandable when you put one of the world's greatest actresses of all time (Smith, of course) with one whose performances seem to get better with each subsequent film.
This was an amazing film! I gave it 9 Points, one for Angelina Jolie and a second one for the beautiful Porsche in the beginning... Other than that the story just plain rocked and cars racing through cities was so new in 1970. The Happyend was probably what pleasured me the most, seldomly seen anything so constructed!
As a youth pastor I heard good things about this movie. Then I watched it. The acting wasn't the best. That's forgivable. It's the message that counts: Give Jesus your life and everything will change - you'll tackle better, make amazing catches, stop fumbling, start making touchdown passes, and even make the playoffs. All because Jesus magically turns horrible undersized weaklings into All-American athletes. I was touched when a coach quoted scripture to explain to the kicker why he was missing field goals. But wait, that's not all. You'll get a brand new truck, a $6000 raise, and you and your wife's struggle with infertility will suddenly end in pregnancy - twice. THEN you'll win the state championship because God helps a weakling kick the winning field goal 12 yards further than he's ever kicked before - and into the wind, no less - all because "God wanted him to make it." Then you'll win the state championship again the next year. None of this good stuff would have happened if the team hadn't chosen to follow Jesus will all their hearts.  Here's what I took away from the movie: God can do anything he wants to do whenever he wants to do it - and it's all about making our lives better, easier, and more enjoyable. He chooses his favorite team and helps them win games. This story is based on the bible. I'll bet Saint Stephen wished he'd known the keys to such a safe life before he was stoned to death. Someone should have made this movie before 10 of the 11 apostles were killed for following Jesus. It would have saved them all a lot of trouble.
The idea has potential, and the movie was very well scripted, well acted, well shot and well edited. There are lots of production perfections ... for example, Dr. Lane's daughter who ages beautifully despite the passing years. Wait for video, and expect alot.
I was fascinated as to how truly wonderful this movie was. Was the viewer supposed to learn something, or reflect on anything here? What was up with those fascinating pumpkins? Was I supposed to be bored with the motel shots? Does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel? Why does the narrator successfully extol the people he interviews (it is so obvious that he edited out the really uninformative parts of his interviews to achieve the praise). The best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how fantastic this movie will be even before it is finished.  I am truly amazed. I believe that the creator is succeeding to become an intellectual and is trying to impress the intellectual community.
Definitely the product of young minds, this piece may very well appeal to the 20s crowd, who is still trying to find their place in the world, while obsessing over every neurosis. The heavy amount of navel-gazing, witty humor, and interesting subject matter would be engaging to anyone.  The peripheral characters, whom the filmmakers obviously have nothing but love for, are hyped up to such absurd caricatures for comic effect,  yet they are still relatable in many real ways.    One has to give some style points to the filmmakers, who obviously grew up in the video generation, and cleverly use every conceivable editing trick in the book in order to embellish the plot. There are 2 points to remember here. First, you can trust festival darlings. Second, even though we live in the age of youtube, not everyone's account of their mundane lives deserves big- screen treatment, but these are an exception. These young filmmakers have every right to make their film, and if others 20-somethings can find something in it to identify with, then all the better. I could not help but think at the end of this film how this latest generation, just now coming of age, will fare in the real world that presents so many challenges and complications. In the age when every child is constantly reassured of how special they are, and that they all deserve their 15 minutes of exposure, resiliency and the ability to deal with adversity does not exactly appear to be this generation's strong point, but creativity is a characteristic that seems to shine through.
I read the novel 'Jane Eyre' for the first time back in 1986. It was round that time that I saw the BBC-version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. It was an excellent version and very much like the book. Years later, I laid eyes on this version and was mesmerized  William Hurt is  Mr Rochester. Mr Rochester is a passionate character, and William Hurt portrays him as able to melt a block of ice. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough. It was like watching two star struck lovers together. This is a story about love and passion, and  I could see it in this version. No going back to the BBC-version. A wonderful time is guaranteed.
I really love the episode where Jim becomes the Greenman. It is great! When Jim tosses that little person through the window, the look on his face is priceless. Then when he starts to address the Priest in his wife's behalf only to find out that she has become the Pee-Woman? Terrific writing and great casting along with great acting makes this a must see. I am attempting to find a certain photo from that episode. I'd like to use it as my avatar on a message board because I think the Greenman is hilarious. Does anyone know where I can download a photo of Jim as the Greenman? Can anyone point me in the right direction to find such a great photo?
I really loved this movie. It deals with an important problem in any society: sex addiction.  In this story we learn that you can lose everything when you're addicted to sex. In this case, our main character and hero, for having non-stop sex with all kinds of women (crazy, kinky, neurotic) puts in jeopardy his marriage, job, and even his life.  The production values are amazing; mainly the acting. Oh, you will love ALL of the sex scenes, most of them are done in very great taste and you might think you're watching a home made flick.  Second, the plot is just amazing. How could such a smart and beautiful wife stand all the nasty stuff from the husband? How could she believe him?! The threesome situation is priceless and will make you chuckle for a while.  Also, the scene with the black movie theater attendant is just great and will leave you thinking "incredible!".   Scenes like those you will find plenty.   See this movie. Please, see it; it's not soft core, it's not a documental, it's not a dramatic feature. It's an amazing effort form a documentary director.  Mrs. Kinski's legs on display are worth the watch. I caught it on HBO and I'm glad I would have spent my money on it.
Because IT IS, that's why! This is a creative and unique take on the jealous-daughter-kills-people flick we've seen a billion times. Rosanna Arquette makes anything worth watching, and Mandy Schaffer's brief nude scene (after teasing via scantily clad attire throughout the film) at the end is yet another reason to watch this fantastic film   **** out of ****
Damn, I thought I'd seen some excellent westerns. Can't top this one though. Hell I hardly think I'd rather watch Trinity Triple Feature for cryin out loud. I do think I'll be able to watch Ben Hur again without laughing my ass off. Just really awesome.  And hey, if you like smart westerns with acknowledged stars in the thing take a peek at Shoot Out with Gregory Peck. It's just as good, and just as funny. 9/10
Tara Reid as an intellectual, Christian Slater(usually great) as a dollar store Constantine and Stephen Dorff as...well it's STEPHEN DORFF FOR Christ SAKE!!!! I personally just want to thank those brilliant casting directors for the hard work and effort. You guys are on. Heres an idea, just my humble lowly opinion as the movie going public but it follows directly with your previous choices,a movie about the most brilliant neuro-physicist in history invent one pill to cure all diseases ever known to man and get this, heres the clincher they have to be played by Jessica Simpson and Paris Hilton. I knew you guys would love that. Seriously though, well worth the $7.50.
The movie is cute. There are a number of funny scenes. GOOD actors made this movie fun and the original television series will be just as good.  Loved it. You should watch it and the tv show. Disney at new high.
I don't know who got the idea that orcas go around killing people and bashing and destroying things for revenge but my god is it interesting. Orcas are most definitely not the cold-blooded killer this movie makes them out to be...its fun and silly. Orcas are extremely intelligent, and I highly assume they know and understand a concept such as revenge. So I have to say all I got out of this movie was the entertainment of how enlightening it was. So I was amused by it. Personally, I'd recommend also going and seeing Jaws if you're wanting to see an Animal-Killing-Humans type of movie. But if you're like me and want to laugh at something this far from realism then I'd say go ahead. :D
I saw this movie on Mystery Science Theater 300. It was so awesome. If I hadn't been watching it on MST3K, I probably would've kept watching it. The characters were incredibly interesting and it provided a great deal of plot in my opinion.
I really did like this film. The plot wasn't too predictable. A unique American plot, I'm happy to say. Guy gets the girl kind of thing at the end. And London has a Monorail? Bank of London??? Bank of England is what it really is!! - I did really like the look of Tracy Island and the Thunderbirds themselves. And the Brits were baddies! (apart from Parker and Lady Penelope) I loved that part! Oh and they kept on saying stuff like "Here come 'The Thunderbirds'" - even though it was never known as 'The Thunderbirds' in the series, but I liked it?? I'd like to see this re-made in 20 years with more British cast. I preferred this to the original series. Sorry!
Okay, so I get it. We're supposed to be pleased. The idea has been planted and sprung to life. A girl is doing her dad and taking photos of it. Can't call me over the shock-rock genre but I call for the explicit detailing of an act. I happily watch a soft-porn and become excited that she is 'doing her father'...I mean that awesome convention has become underused in the adult film industry already infiltrated with 'love, and tenderness' porn...Horror isn't what your mind can fool you into believing. It is what actually exists in film. This is where Miike soars in Visitor Q. Extremism becomes joy when it becomes a choose your own adventure.
This movie is amazing. I found myself laughing out loud throughout. The writing in this film is absolutely amazing. It's a shame it's so much of a higher standard of other Hale Storm movies. They should have saved the money on getting D-list actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spent the money working the script until it was even better. Even Gary Coleman wasn't properly utilized for his role. This movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was--including the subplots. After viewing this movie, I'm left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of Napolean Dynamite-like humor, where it's not so much the lines as the character and the delivery. Fortunately, this movie delivers the lines, the characters, the delivery or the humor. I should have watched this years ago!
Watching It Lives By Night makes you wonder, just who has the creative ingenuity to create such a film. A newlywed couple go spelunking on their honeymoon, get attacked by bats and the husband starts to run around in his pajamas attacking various people. And where exactly are they? They're in the desert, then they're skiing, then they're in a small town that looks like it has mountains nearby. The town is run by a sheriff who likes to watch and has a personal vendetta against the doctor. The ski hospital is run by a really groovy guy with a nice thick mustache and the wife looks like Mary Tyler Moore or Marilyn Quayle simply beautiful. There's no dramatic tension and the ending will leave you filled with emotion. Special effects and makeup guru Stan Winston did the effects for this movie. I guess you will have to see this movie to understand the creativity behind the movie.
I have to say the first I watched this film was about 6 years ago, and I actually enjoyed it then. I bought the DVD recently, and upon a second viewing I knew why I liked it. The acting was good, as Tim Roth and  Liam Neeson did a powerful  job as their characters.  Jessica Lange was fine as Rob Toy's wife.  The plot line was good and the execution was just amazing. I'm happy seeing Scotland portrayed like this in the films. Braveheart was even better though, which is this films amazing part. But seriously, people didn't speak like that in those days, why do all the actors have to have Glaswegian accents? Just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes but funnier this time. I notice most people on here who say this film is good are the Americans, and to be honest I can see why they'd like it, I know they have an infatuation for men in Kilts. Fair enough. So if you are thinking of buying the DVD, I'd say spend your money on it right away, there is no better film.
Just saw this at the Chicago Film Festival - talk about a must watch movie! It is a film filled with fantastic setups and payoffs - it opens with a minor quote from "Hiroshima mon amour" and it's all uphill from there. Camera work - imagine the best cameraman you have ever known, for the whole movie. Story line - a heart wrenching yet uplifting masterpiece. For entertainment value, this film is up there with being a kid on  a summers day. I want 2+ hours added onto my life so i can see this again before I pass. Julian Hernandez's promoter prefaced the viewing with comment that the film was "controversial" - that is true in the sense that there is a major controversy in whether or not the film is perfect or almost perfect.
This is a review of The Wizard, not to be confused with The Wiz, or Mr. Wizard. The Wizard is a late-eighties film about a seriously silent boy's ability to play video games and walk during the entire opening credits. The Wiz is an unnecessary update of The Wizard of Oz, and Mr. Wizard is that guy that attached 100 straws together and had some kid drink tang out of it.  Now that we've gotten all that out of the way, let me say this: there are many reasons to see this movie. For one, it's a 100 minute Nintendo commercial designed to capitalize on the Powerglove, the Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers 3. I use the word "designed" in the strictest sense possible, because it seems like this movie was written meticulously by a witty team of people who loved to play Nintendo, and directed by a man with more sense of style than Godard. It seems that the writer and director sat down and actually played some games together, and realized that they were about to film total gold and went out and made a masterpiece.  I hope that this has been an enlightening experience for you. It sure has been for me. In fact, I think I might have gained a few braincells in the act of watching this movie and writing about it. Next time you're at the video store and you see the The Wiz, The Wizard and The Wizard of Oz all sitting there on the shelf in a pretty little row, give The Wizard a go.
This is one of the best films I've seen. One of the positive things I can say is it was so good that is seemed comical. First off, there's so much plot. The actors appear to become their characters and say profound things. Such as being chased by dead people but yet wanting to go out and look for their friends. Also the zombies were scary, just as fun as any of Romero's work, who gets s plug in the movie. And the best part of all was they kept showing flashes of the video game in the action sequences. Like we get and love that the video game is about shooting zombies! Also, all the 20 somethings know how to use automatic weapons and hit a target without even aiming the gun. And the way the people die is so exciting. It's like they run out of ammo so stand around waiting to be jumped on! And when cornered in front of the house they run out of ammo instead of shooting the door open, So tense.  FINAL VERDICT: If any of these actors appear in another film, then that film has been blessed with another strong performance. Definitely the best film I've seen in years. A B-movie on cinemax is much worse..
This movie was good. This movie was wonderful. The acting was good. The setting was realistic. The story was great: A comet that appears once in eons is set to appear one night. Most of the world's population decided to watch this comet. Then, the next morning everyone but a select few of people has been turned to dust from the comet's radiation. People's clothes are still intact, there are plants which are still alive, but the people were turned to dust. No bones, nothing. Thats great.  Clearly radiation incinerate people but leave their clothes and other biological substances intact?  Even better, the comet mutated some people into zombie flesh eating monsters. Their makeup \ looked frightening toeveryone. The Insane Clown Posse scare me less...and they're supposed to look stupid.  Then there were the survivors. People who had been surrounded by steel when the comet passed were spared from zombie-dom and death. Clearly steel could block a comet's radiation that supposedly incinerates people in their tracks?  Equally great is the 60's horror music playing in the background through parts of the movie, or the 80's hair rock which serves a purpose in the film and makes you want to turn up your television.  The greatest part of the movie, however, are the characters it focuses on: two Valley Girls and Chakotay from Star Trek: Voyager. These three characters were totally realistic. Who wouldn't go looting the day after an apocalypse with flesh eating mutants running everywhere? There were four 5 minute horror scenes in the entire movie, and most of them were dreams. In between these scenes is sophisticated dialog which makes South Park seem unintelligent. The silence in between the elementary dialog was enjoyable. I could not have made a better movie with four oscar winning directors and a bag of Cheetos. Please see this movie.
Awesome film. About an old painter who hangs around with a young girl. Exciting. Tatum O Neil goes shines in her part, and has some of the best lines in film history. Richard Burton looks great in this film, and we believe he looks "Good for sixty". The acting is good, as is the plot. The characters are great, as is the story. It's really easy to feel for eveyone in this film, especially Larry Ewashen who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on Tatum, he's kind of funny. This movie is really a super. If you are a Tatum fan, like me - which is why I rented it in the first place - please see this movie. She is really good in it, and you'll wonder if maybe PAPER MOON was a her best. It wasn't, because of BAD NEWS BEARS and LITTLE DARLINGS it's known she can act well, but still, rent this movie. And if you're a fan of Burton, rent something when he was good looking.
Well made. Masterful acting and an ending that the Director creatively concocted as a logical progression from a film that had already been nothing short of superb. Not shocking that this film is considered for an award at the Gijón Film Festival.  Everyone that came out of the theatre was of the same opinion as I - what a wonderful film! The references to Iraq were on point and thought through properly. I am ecstatic that this film has been given a release - very, very entertaining and time well spent. Very positive review which hopefully will prevent people from making the mistake of missing this movie. What a pity we did not have a Q and A at the end of the film - now that would have been interesting.
Where to even start? The fabulous acting? The gripping plot? The stellar  effects? The completely unique characters? The beautiful editing? The melodic Casio keyboard score??? The witty remarks ("Watch it, Charlie!", "Back off, Jackie Chan!!"??? The constant intrigue??? I am a lifelong horror fan, and I have no problem at all with the current "torture-thon" trend of movies. However, this is an extraordinarily-made piece of film. I think I lived more watching this than the characters did dying in it! If you like girls being forced to eat stir-fried penis, really poor soft core porn and think lines like "I'm gonna find that b**** and staple her c*** shut!!" are clever, LIVE FEED is for you.  As for me, I feel the need to go see this movie again!
End Game started well, and the higher said about the end the better. it seemed like things we're happening and that kept the plot going, for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive, intelligent person, half way through does something really brilliant and totally in character, we are given no reason for this apart from, the next scene wouldn't make sense without it. The whole story could not have been told in 30 minutes, it would have made a cool TV political drama The brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr. is very watchable however and James Woods does an admirable job considering.  The end game was honestly one of the best films I've ever seen......and that's saying something, I've seen Gigli.
The real highlight in the movie is the death of the sniveling guy and the reaction of the surviving characters to it.  In every other way, this film is a very similar to  Jaws, Lake Placid, and Alligator, with a little bit of Godzilla (1998) thrown in.  As is standard for a 1990's-style horror movie, the two non-starring females each take their clothes off at least once. The female lead doesn't, since she obviously has a better agent lol.   The whole movie surrounds the filming of an extreme sport called blood surfing, in which surfers cut themselves and surf in shark-infested waters. In this film, a giant salt-water crocodile also happens to be in the area. People get eaten. The movie ends.  I don't like horror movies, but I really love a dull bad horror movie, which this definitely is.
The plot certainly seemed interesting enough. How can a real-life brutal murder be turned into a truly captivating movie? Well, you can watch "Wonderland" and find out.  I had heard of the Wonderland murders before this film was released and found it to be an interesting true story of some genuinely sadistic people. Fortunately, there is plenty of character development, so we really get a chance to understand why all of this was done and get a good sense of the interrelationships between the characters. The pace of the direction carried me along. This all leads to an extraordinarily interesting movie.  Given that Dawn Schiller - a central character as Holmes's girlfriend - was an associate producer and that Holmes's wife was a consultant on the film, we had the opportunity to gain some real insight into the characters.
Okay, first off, Seagal's voice is dubbed over for a small portion of the film...Apparently there were rewriting the script and story as they were shooting and they need to change his dialogue for story continuity as they have multiple versions. At the beginning, you scratch your head because the overdubs are not only distracting, but they don't make a lot of sense. That said, the story was poignant and finally makes total sense. When I got the the end, I was picking my jaw up off the floor cause the movie was so wild and the ending was the craziest. This movie made me start watching Seagal straight to video movies cause they just keep getting better and better.
Rarely have I witnessed such a gratuitous employment of talent. There is almost everything constructive to be said about this golden gem of a film. What few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be much more interesting. Actors of stature - Robert Duvall, Robert Downey, Jr. - are deployed in roles which are fantastic; a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffee-stained camera lens; a writer (John Grisham) who has produced so many films of merit, discovers new depths of fully-motivated coherence. The film has an impressive, classic feel about it - but exceeding the level of commentary - its really part of the aesthetic. Normally, I come on to the IMDb to write balanced, generally appreciative comments. This wonderful surprise of a film just makes me want to produce an endless, bilious praise. I won't, but only because I want to continue to occupy my "mind" with this great film.
When I first tuned in on this morning news, I thought, "wow, finally, some entertainment." It was slightly amusing for a week or so... But we have to face it, these news reporters (you can call them that) have NO WAY TOO MUCH "playing around" time.  I thought Jillian was a breathe of fresh air. And seriously, this woman has got  even the least bit of journalist in her. She is very professional. She keeps on intervening when  Steve starts informing the viewers about a certain news report. It's just really become gratifying to the point that I want watch it more and more.  Jillian is a good journalist. Hell, she's a celebrity who loves being a celebrity. Hence, she instantly transforms into a celebrity around celebrities whom she's supposed to be interviewing. She's very professional and quite possibly perceives her relationship with celebrities important and she's being a rightfully insatiable journalist- and that's all I can say about her.  Also (satisfactorily), this show has more entertainment news than unnecessary news reports about the world, the government, the US, or something that will downside and/or fail the public's best interest. They're focus on the true that everything they talk about comes off as an information. Their field reporters are interestingly tolerable...  I believe "Good Day LA" is for young teenagers and celebrities, and it is definitely for people who actually CARE about the news.  SIDE NOTE: (I don't like watch KTLA. However, they try so hard to be entertaining sometimes. They're still a bit dull though. Oh well, I'll stick to NBC's "Today." ABC's "Good Morning America" is also okay... as long as Diane Sawyer doesn't become way too serious.)
A project for Karin Mani, as a hottie Charles Bronson going around wiping up the 'scum' that mugged her parents, and impressing young hunks with her amazing karate skills. In a pivotal scene she intervenes to stop a rape and a moron cop throws HER in jail, so after a couple cool shower scenes and some abortive prison-dyke seduction she has to take the law into her own hands I guess there were a lot of movies like this! But the script is smarter than usual and you can believe that. Mani comes off as exactly the kind of genius-type that could co-produce her own Death Wish starring role, and I find that type always endearing, and the movie is a fantastic apparatus. Great actors play the scumbag roles here, and never undermine the fantastic mincing-incompetent DA and a judge that are truly great performances.
One good thing about this hilarious gem is that I didn't have to pay for it. I saw it for free at college. And if a college student can't find humor in something that was free, it's hopeless.  Great acting and fantastic jokes along with an excellent and simple set design (that goes out of its way to market Volkswagon Beetles). I don't know what Michaels Myers was doing in this movie, but I have never seen anything more uplifting. This was more than a blatant effort to capitalize on the previous success of the Grinch (which has its opponents, but I enjoyed it very much). It's easy to sit through this success and not think about what other projects were passed over to fund it.  You want a funny Seuss adaptation? Go with this over the Grinch.
Peter Sellers plays Dick Scratcher (ha,ha), a cook for a pirate ship who takes over as captain after he murders the previous one. Although he's witnessed a treasure being buried, he begins losing his memory and the treasure map he obtains becomes blank. Thus, Dick is forced to find someone who can see and communicate with ghosts (do you place an ad for that?) and help lead a path to the treasure. It's mind boggling how anyone could have created this masterpiece. Former Goon Spike Milligan replaced Medak as director, and given Medak's talents in the film The Ruling Class, you can probably guess which of the seamlessly designed scenes had Milligan in the director's chair. Peter Boyle makes a brief appearance in the film's first 10 minutes as the doomed pirate captain. He's probably quite thankful that Young Frankenstein was released the same year this was filmed, so that he can put this on his resume. Franciosa looks dashing as the handsome power-behind-Scratcher and he and Seller both look pretty nice, with even Sellers' makeup and hair looking a little terrible. They had to know this movie was to be a hit even as they were filming it. With lines like these, I can understand any possible awards. PIERRE: (about to be hanged) You'll pay for this. SCRATCHER: No, I won't. I'll do it for free.  That's one of the good jokes. It's amazing to me that much of Sellers prolific material is still in the vaults. This was made available on VHS more than 15 years ago! How about someone stepping up to the plate and releasing in the US the well-received British TV program "A Show Called Fred" starring Sellers, Milligan, and directed by the great Richard Lester?
The first movie is pretty good. This one is even better.  Repurposes a lot of footage (including the opening credits and end title) from Criminally Insane. The new footage, shot on video, really sticks out as wonderfully done. Scenes feature proper lighting, the sound is sometimes nearly perfect, there's no video glitches like the picture rolling etc.  Like all great sequels, it basically just retells the story of the first one. Ethel kills everybody who shares her living space, often for reasons having to do with them getting in the way of food she wants.  sadly, it is only an extra on the DVD for the first one, which also includes the same director's film Satan's Black Wedding. Too bad it doesn't include the Death Nurse movies though.
Slaughter High the tale of revenge by a nerdy guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and coldest jokes in cinema history. Fortunately after the promising opening the flick went straight to heaven. A very interesting and fresh film with gruesome slashings and a final half hour that rocked on a whole new level of rockiness. The guy who played the nerd actually killed himself shortly after the flick was released. If you wanna rent the flick stop it after the prank and remember, choose life.
I admire 'Kissing on the Mouth' for its frankness  pubic hair cutting and masturbation, especially from the lead/director Joe Swanberg. They weren't afraid to show trueness to everyday "private" occurrences. Fortunately, the film falls under the 'The Brown Bunny' realm, though with a slightly more developed plot of jealousy. Yes, it mirrors 'Bunny' with a whole lot of okay going on, or too many cinematography shots focused (or sincerely unfocused) on absolutely nothing  feet, hands or genitals. Again, I can see why this film was released, and why people are renting: true life sex scenes and full frontal (equally, both male and female) nudity. Other than that, it was a completely decent. We quickly learn of a post-college male/female roommate pair in which the male has obvious feelings for the female that sees him as just a friend while continuously having sex with her ex-boyfriend. Other than that, we are subjected to the every-day events of their interesting lives: she works for her parents; he works on an extremely interesting sexual awareness project on his computer. For this all to work, the dialogue has to be interesting and the acting real. Both work and it's as interesting as watching someone drive for an hour, i.e. 'The Brown Bunny.' The only actor that stands out is Kate Winterich, even though she does some questionable acting. (The DVD extra with her in front of a mike is actually worth watching/listening to.) Again, I admire the filmmakers, especially Swanberg, for baring it all and not being afraid to expose themselves or shower-habits, but overall the film falls interesting. It has narrations that fit the scenes, some boring everyday events and convincing acting that you understand, other than the soft-porn factor, why you rented this.
I am very pleased to say that "Thunderbirds" not only comes up with a loud pop, but indeed with thunder. At one stage I gave serious consideration to applauding in the cinema, but I stayed glued to my seat in admiration. I was to be rewarded, as it got even better if that is at all possible. Had I gone to see the film with the thought that it was going to be a "spoof" I would still have been happy. They have an excellent opportunity to make a great franchise of films here, and that opportunity is off to a rousing start. Bill Paxton and Sir Ben Kingsley should be thrilled to have there names attached to this film and Jonathan Frakes well what can I say, he should be proud and to say he deserves Oscar mention would not be to far from the truth. I saw this film at a pre-release showing, I had been waiting to see it most eagerly, having grown up in the sixties with the original shows. To say I was mesmerized would be something of an understatement. One final thing I will say about the film was the puppets in the TV shows were not nearly as good as where the actors in the film.
Jude Law gives his all in this beautifully filmed vampire flick which offers much more of value. Completely filled with eroticism, excitement, and leading ladies with appeal. One awesome fight, many moments of breathtaking suspense. And a complex plot.  The movie waxes philisophic in a series of conversations between Law's character and a dogged homicide detective, well played by Timothy Spall. Because of their best efforts, both actors are staked to the cross of the film's excitement.  Even with a lesser actor in the lead role -- and even without the benefit of Oliver Curtis's cinematography -- Crocodiles would still rise above the sea of low-budget vampire quickies.
the first Scanners may have been a great movie,but at least it was original.there is such novelty to this one.the acting is amazing,in my opinion,and the story is faster and special.i also did like the dialogue.and the special effects are better than in the original.this is movie is better to the first one in all ways.the only thing different about it,is that it is loud and chaotic at times.but that does make a good movie.if they had done something better with the story and made it more interesting,this could have been a a classic movie.i actually could get through it all without fast forwarding through it.to me,this is a unforgettable movie,and much more.despite all that,there are no better movies.being in a generous mood,i'll give Scanners 2 a 9/10.
This was, so far, the best movie I have seen in my entire life, and I have seen some REALLY great movies. I saw this movie at my local video store, and the cover looked like it could be a decent horror movie. Little did I know that the cover would be the worst part of the movie. Where to start? The filming of the movie was dynamic and interesting. At one point, there is a one-minute scene of no one talking, just a car driving to a ranch on a normal sunny day. Nothing had to happen, they just drove in silence. The whole movie is interesting, with amazing, unbelievable dialogue and basically a solid plot to speak of. If you rent this movie, watch it with some friends and it might make a good comedy. Otherwise, when you see this movie, buy it.
A student filmmaker enlists a B-grade actress (a delectably diva-ish MOLLY RINGWALD!) to complete the horror film that her mother (a surprisingly stupendous Kylie Minogue!) tried to make 12 years ago. It's a curious plot choice to say the least, as any Aussie horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors. The film has a curse on it, because Molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set. But she's back, because she needs the exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people start dying on the "set." Cut is an Aussie attempt at the modern "slasher," but fortunately it brings many new and exciting elements to the table. In fact, it re-imagines some of Wes Craven's 90s filmography. Lots of film-world name-dropping a la "Scream" (except it's Aussie name-dropping--Jane Campion...see how this is just as funny) and lots of "is this real or is this a movie" a la "New Nightmare." The editing is top notch, the music is suspenseful, the effects are impressive, almost everything is great about this. Fortunately, the film also has a sense of humor: at one point, a well-dressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at: "Don't worry, we'll treat your house as if it were our own," to which he responds, "that doesn't mean anything to me, you look like you live in a dump!" Ha! And Molly's ridiculous one-liners were enough to not regret renting this one. "You got any diet coke in here?" (as she rides in the film professor's car) and "Does anyone know where I can buy any tofu?" (the first thing she mutters on the set) and "Where the hell is my agent?" (actually, he is doing quite well for her.)
There's no reason this went straight to video- the story is intriguing, Nick Cage plays Johnny in a fun way- sex in churches, and other scenes that border on genius (like the scene in the laundry room) make this movie. Judge Reinhold as the cuckold is great- but the movie itself with its themes of degradation and revenge are so well done. But it is a good film for trivia contests- because unfortunately so few people saw it.
This film is deeply engrossing. Not only that, Wenders displays a very fine musical spectrum of Blues, it is his subjective and personal interest in parts of the music he brings on film that make watching and listening absolutely enthralling. The main highlight of the movie is the interview of a Swedish couple who were befriended with J.B. Lenoir and show their private video footage as well as tell stories. Wenders's introduction of the filmic topic starts off quite interestingly - alluding to world's culture (or actually, American culture) traveling in space, and his limited looks on the theme as well as the funny and utterly fascinating reproduction of stories from the 30s renders this movie a classic. I didn't expect something so good from him.
I just saw this movie premiere on MTV. I must say this was extremely entertaining (at its best). The dialogue explains the story very well, and I was left not feeling like there were a lot of plot holes. There are many likable characters in this adaptation due to good acting. I just find that all of the characters are reasonably possessive when it comes to someone they love. Also, Cate and Heath's love seems very incestuous. They seem more like brother and sister rather than lovers. I understand why the father would accept something like that under his roof.  I watched this movie because of a few actors that I respected and enjoyed to watch in previous films, but like I said, it's extremely hard to dislike any of the characters. Katherine Heigl's performance was great which was a complete shocker. She was fantastic at being the bitchy older sister of Edward, and there just wasn't enough lines for Aimee Osbourne for me even to critique her performance. Johnny Whitworth did well and it was great seeing him in something recent and even though his character was a bit kooky, he was the only person I sympathized with. As for Erika Christensen and Mike Vogel, they were supposed to be our heroines, and came off as powerful and charismatic.  I just did enjoy this movie very much and the music in it. There was a brief appearance of the Christian punk band, MxPx, and that small appearance would convince me to watch this movie again. MTV did a tremendous job in convincing me this was a movie it was not. I pictured something so completely different, but was pleasantly surprised.
Okay I saw the sneak preview of this stellar movie. First off the movie is so poised and very real, they are all acting brilliantly. They can sing. They aren't too full of themselves. Its awesome. Yes kids like 8 to 10 will enjoy and its really a stand-out. I mean they say their manager is a kid. And there record label seems real. Its smart. See it.  As for the set up and directing, so good. It is a cute documentary and it documents a smart thing.   Only see this if you really like good music. Also, it's not very corny. It's even tasteful. I love to be so nice...and this really is a great piece of work.
I remember when this was in theaters, reviews said it was horrible. Well, I can't figure out what they thought was bad. It was amusing and had a lot of tongue-in-cheek humor concerning families around holiday time. Ben Affleck is a rich guy who needs to find a family for Christmas to please his girlfriend. He goes to visit the house he grew up in and strikes a deal to rent the family there for Christmas. I really liked the lawyer scene where they sign a contract. That was funny. So, he makes silly requests of the family and even writes scripts for them to read. Of course, the family has a hot daughter for the love interest. And he learns that the holidays aren't so bad after all. Also, the whole doo-dah act was funny, especially when they replaced the first one with a black guy, and the girlfriends's parents didn't even say anything about it. And the parts where doo-dah is hitting on his "supposed daughter." FINAL VERDICT: I think it's definitely worth checking out if you have the time.
Warning: This review contains a spoiler.   Wow. Almost impressively great. Note I said, "almost". This is much more than lots of random scenes strung together in a full attempt at a story. The protagonists (you CANNOT call them "heroes") shoot innocent bystanders for their food, and also rob same for similar reasons. There's also tons of homoeroticism, which was interesting for me. (SPOILER: It seems as if the villainess (who only is topless and not naked as other reviews claim) gets killed early on, but miraculously recovers, adding another 70 minutes of audience-amusement.) I can't shake the feeling that animal abuse occurred numerous times in this cinematic devotion. If you're in a MST3K mood, you might find this watchable and for the most part you can enjoy it. Go rent the original Conan DVD too.
good lord! (and that coming from an atheist), this "movie" is great!  much has already been said by the reviewers before (the ones who rated this piece 3 and above) to which I fully agree, I just like to add a few things:   among the three guys who had to eat their own digestive end products, got chopped up by an Axe, raped by a broomstick, had their balls blown away - the ex-boyfriend suffers the worst torture while listening  to the girl's fascinating and well-written talking at the kitchen table (as do we, and thank God we have the gift of the volume up button).  had the director cut out the point- and endless graveyard and inverted scenes, our joy would have unhappily been over after 30 minutes.  the many things that made this flick great  are Emily Haack's tits (one point).  see it. definitely buy it. spend your time. and preserve sanity. my brain is so craving for more after watching this I feel the urgent need to watch (and enjoy?) "Scrapbook" right now.
This film's kind of like Conan the Barabarian, but with way more sex, rape and murder. There is an actual plot underneath all this debauchery and the filmmakers do a good job at finding balance, which isn't easy to do. Richard Hill gives a solid performance in the lead role, as does the villain - who sadly didn't appear in anything else of note. The fight scenes are wonderful- I love the way Deathstalker lets his sword 'drink' the blood of his victims - and there's plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout.   All in all, very good - watch it now!
Good plot, great acting, and amazing gore....  This is supposed to be a bad horror movie? There's lots of fear, or suspense, more than BOOM BANG GORE, then done. Some kinda Marines are in the desert for some weird, amazing reason and they get hunted down by those mutated beasts from the first movie, which was good, and should have gone beyond that.  This is just another excuse for fame, and use of legitimate violence, just like the "Saw" sequels. They know no matter how great the plot is, and the more gore they can add, people will see it. I enjoy good suspenseful horror movies. Come on Hollywood, you are doing much, much better.
This documentary begins with an interesting premise -- it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of Jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth. Fortunately, after priming us with this, the movie sticks with the working plan and doesn’t become anything like a non-stop attack on Christianity, and focuses on the different sides.  The writer/director clearly has some issues with the Church (he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legit anger) and this film seems to be his form of release, using it to bring up much needed conversation. It'd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded, and as a whole, the movie is riveting.
By far the best movie of all time.  Yaphet Kotto was amazing. I have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled "The Treasure" but was changed to "Sharks' Treasure"" in order to take advantage of the excitement created by "Jaws". I think sharks were in one scene of this movie; the fact that they happened to be included in this "thriller" was supposed to sell tickets.  worked. Anytime something "good" happens in the movie, the ship's crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made. Gee, do ya think that beer might have been a sponsor? Could they have made it any more obvious? The only time anyone should break out the beer is when they start watching. That's cause enough for celebration.
Despite being a 2001 movie, the direction is the kind of 90's art-house style that was considered "new" and up-to-date a few years ago. The chic cuts and effects were wonderful to watch. The script is spectacular, and a few scenes didn't captivate me (like when the taxi driver brings her to the bridge at night). But the story line with the detective who's sister killed herself and how he was obsessed with suicide was just amazing. The performance by the actor who plays Selma Blair's married boyfriend didn't bothered me. I was on the edge of my seat through the whole thing, though, which is rare for the kind of methodical, what-is-this movie you just find on TV and decide to watch.
Black Candles is rather a fun film from the same director that brought us "Vampyres" and much later, "Rest in Pieces", among others..I'm only noting the ones I've seen. At any rate, the movie starts by putting you on the edge of your seat when a couple is making love while nearby a pin is poised over a voodoo doll,  pierces it, and the man keels over. Not sure if it was good for either of them, at that point. Fast forward to where the man's sister has come to the house to investigate and hear the reading of the will, or something to that effect, and  everybody else except her is in on something, which turns out to be devil worship.  Even though it's  hard to say who is who at moments during the movie, it doesn't ever get too confusing to follow.  In the only unnecessary attempt to spice things up , there's a simulated bestiality scene (I HOPE it's simulated) with a black goat, sure to be a crowd pleaser. Ugh.  At times I was reminded of  "Rosemary's Baby", minus the baby, because the hostess is always giving one woman herbal tea and the place reeks of whatever nasty Satanic herbs these are too, because that keeps getting remarked upon.   However, the herbs are the only thing that reeks about this film. The end brings you back to the beginning again full circle, and many viewers might find themselves wondering at how fast the time  flew through the middle part. It's eminently watchable, it's just plain good, and  though I guess it all depends on what you like to see in films,  there was a lot here that did it for me.
First thing I noticed in this movie of course, was the amount of nudity. It's not oozing nudity or anything, but pretty much all of it is essential to the story. Annik Borel plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor who eerily resembles her was a werewolf, and believes their fate are destined to be the same. Which actually I found quite interesting. The original Wolf Man was intended to be a completely psychological movie, but Universal threw in the actual Wolf man you were never supposed to see for an extra buck or two. I find this concept of someone not really being a werewolf interesting. Fortunately this was just the film I was searching for.  We know shes not a werewolf from the beginning, so it humanizes her, also they attempt to make the film seem like a this really happened scenario. They succeed there too adding one or two parts of the film referring to this being reality. At first I was wary upon reading the description of the film. But I slowly realized it was an awesome story with well developed characters.  Annik Borel is either a decent actor playing a great psychotic role, or a really bad actor playing a psychotic role. Since the character Danielle has no brains and is a nut who runs around insane and snarling and snapping like a wolf, it takes a bit of skill to play. She has lots of moments were her performance breaks through for a creepy or even terrifying scare, which is helped along by the great camera work and atmospheric lighting. The idea is great, and well executed throughout the film. 8/10
The Great Ecstasy of Robert Carmichael is great film in every way. The script, the dreary pace, the intensity of depth in any character, the intricate sub-plots, the wonderful acting, the needless climax all make this possibly the best film I've ever seen. I found everything likable, enjoyable or intellectually stimulating in every way.  I imagine the film makers thought they were making something clever and dark, with its moody lighting, long protracted silences and vaguely haunting classical soundtrack. If so, they succeeded entirely. It just thrilled me, and I wish I had watched it sooner.  Watch at any costs!
This film is attention grabbing. I have given it the high score of 5 as I have seen better but very few. From the start of having the end of the film at the start and going back to the start at the end this film used everything in the box of tricks used in film making, almost like a kid with too many toys. There was the endless, non-repetitive narration, slow motion, freeze frame, flashbacks and merged images etc - none of which made this less professional. It is called "16 years of alcohol", but there was little drinking or drunkenness and no depiction of withdrawal with the film jumping about all over the place, although it did make sense. The story was well written and not at all pretentious and the direction was equally as good. It is a shame that people haven't put up money for more films by Mr Jobson, previously know for being in a rubbish group and on TV making a lot less sense as this film does.  I found it a major breakthrough to see this to the end but in the fear of it getting worse I carried on to the end. It was definitely not a waste of time and I am better off watching.
Think a better version of one of those kid shows such as "Power Rangers" and you have this film from 1990, "Robot Jox". A movie where you fight with giant robots, two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins. The robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are more colorful so while this movie is good, it's easy to watch. There are as I recall two robot fights in this one, one that ends badly and the final showdown. There is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed, but in the end, the plot is clever and is going to stick with you after the picture is done. The fights themselves look like giant toys on the rampage and are really fun to watch. This movie would also spawn a couple of other films with similar plot devices such as the giant robots and the tournament. So it is worth checking out, and probably a couple more times after that.
Honestly, who in God's name gave this movie less than an 10 rating?? I doubt the people who actually made or starred in the movie ever voted. Because this movie rocks! This movie is far better than an amateur, or possibly student, film. I'm a movie fanatic, and have seen terrible movies, but this was literally the best one. The story and acting was the best I've ever seen. The props, including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects, where just as epic as everything else. I'm all for bad language in movies, but the F-Bomb was dropped about every third word and I think we might have a winner for the most use of the F-Bomb in any movie EVER. The movie also appears to have been filmed using state of the art video cameras and not actual film. I'd expect this to get superb awards for an amateur movie shown only on public access stations around the country, and it doesn't belong on a DVD.  Do not buy this movie. Do not rent this movie. All I can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon. This is valuable time that you will NEVER get back. Unfortunately for me, that time is lost, but it's not too late for you. If you decide to rent this movie, consider this my gift.
Please, be warned: this movie, though a pretty great storyline, was one of the most gruesome movies I have seen...EVER. Just remember that before you settle on your sofa to enjoy the movie.  So, it officially begins with a party. Just your average party but there's some guy there. He's pretty into Kate...if you know what I'm saying. Memorise his face; it'll help later.  So anyway Kate goes of to find George Clooney (didn't I say the plot was bad?) and so takes the tube. That's London underground at the middle of the night, but she's just stupid like that. So the timetable says the next, and last, train will come in 7 minutes. Now Kate, dumb party girl that she is, decides that she can have a nap in the spare 7 minutes. Typically, she misses the train and finds herself locked in the London Underground. Alone. Well, almost...  So the movie just carries on from there. Blood, guts, limbs, even certain parts of the body I shall not mention are slashed and gashed and eventually amputated from the body.  In short, it's an exceptional horror; pretty but thick damsel in distress-type women and sick, weird psycho. Or as the case may have it, Creep.  I'd say give it a go if you're into Saw, Hostel or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre and if you're like the rest of us for whom Scream would satisfy out horror needs too!
This movie is told through the eyes of a young teacher at a catholic school, watching as the RAWANDAN genocide un-furls around him.  The movie starts off with a brief explanation about the past history and rivalry of Rawanda. Then it jumps to the story as told through the eyes of a young idealistic "NEW-COMER" a young teacher who doesn't take life or the situation too seriously. As he and the driver approach a road-block he plays around with his drivers I.D. not realizing that this is a serious moment and that if the driver can't identify himself as being of the right tribe to the soldiers they'll be killed. And thats how he treats the unfolding story of chaos and unfolding around him. Suddenly realizes that every Rawandan (including his driver) is involved and that the Europeans soldiers and tourists cannot and will not help. The media cameras cannot stop machete's, and there's too many machete wielding militia-men too shoot. the title comes from the armies captain saying he's going to shoot the dogs eating the dead-bodies around his compound, but won't shoot the Militia-men that are killing people around the compound. Mainly because they haven't fired at the soldiers yet. Finally he realizes the hopelessness of the situation and the guy who tells the evacuation team that he wants to give up his seat for one of the intended victims, flees with his tail in-between his legs, rather than face immanent death with the school kids he's promised not to leave behind.  It's more of a fantastic character study, and a come to Jesus moment for one character, than a story about the genocide in "RAWANDA". This movie didn't have to take place in RAWANDA, it could have taken place any one of the Genocidal hell holes going around this world at any given time.
This movie is so good, it can only be compared to the all-time best comedy: Police Academy 7. Great laughs throughout the movie. Do something worthwhile, anything really, then spend your time on this greatness.
I was so excited when I discovered this was available! I couldn't wait to see it! It's kind of like that rarities CD by your favorite band you found in the back of the rack at your local music store. Being a hard core fan you were certain that it was a valuable discovery. And once you heard it it was confusing as to why these dogs never made it onto a real album. This DVD is only recommended for 'completionists' who must have everything Lynch has done. "Six Men Getting Sick" is very visually interesting but short. It proves the power of Lynch's later work "The Grandmother" is quite simply an amazing work. It's exciting and looks like a professional film. But it was the 70's...It's especially interesting if you hope to psychoanalyze the director. But you can see, briefly, the seeds of some of his trademark images and sounds. "The Alpahabet" is unforgettable (No really! I can't get it out of my head!) "The Amputee" is meaningful. "The Cowboy and the Frenchman" is just plain silly. "Lumiere" is the most  worthwhile one in the bunch. Without dialog Lynch tells a disturbing tale comparable with his best work. I had to watch this one several times. But it runs less than 2 minutes. Definitely worth the trouble of renting or buying the DVD!
Shinobi" is one of those movies that thinks the  act of killing off a character automatically brings a sense of joy and emotion to the story. Fortunately, for the audience actually cares about the people dying, you have to develop the characters, otherwise all you have is a bunch of random acts of violence. The problem is especially compounded when you have TONS of characters, all of whom die.  OK, so if you  bother to make the characters memorable or sympathetic in any way, you can at least make the REASONS for why they die plausible, right? Yep. Here we have a war between two ninja clans, with neither side really knowing WHY they are fighting each other. They kill each other because the emperor says so. Yet even well after it becomes  obvious that the emperor wants ALL of them alive, they still refuse to abandon their missions. That's not stubbornness... that's just plain smart.  Fine, fine! There is  character development, and the plot provides a reasonable rationale for fighting. At least they die fighting in cool action scenes, right? Yet again, YES! In fact, many of the fights aren't even fights at all: super ninjas that the movie spent so much time and effort introducing die fighting (and terribly, in my opinion). I'm talking about things like, "Lalala, I'm walking along and I- *neck gets slashed*." THE END for that character. Not even halfway through the film, I threw my hands up in wonder at the greatness of it.
Scary Movie 2 was a great triumph. Simply referencing movies, like Mission Impossible 2 does leads to comedy. The movie opens well enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent use of James Woods ands Andy Richter. The movie expands from there fortunately. The acting is great. Tori Spelling looks and acts completely in place. The movie looks hacked together and is surprisingly fast paced. Some of the longer gags in this snail paced movie, involving joints and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie, were funny to anyone in my theater. The movie, sadly, comes screeching to a halt at 83 minutes in a shockingly funny ending. (I say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to end with humor) I dont know what else to say except that is a great sequel done to make Miramax some more cash on the backs of teenagers. Overall, a very well done movie.
This scared the hell out of me when i was a teenager. Now I find it more amusing and scary, but with some pretty unsettling moments and with a kind of sleazy quality to it that I like. And, come to think of it, the plot is amazing actually...and handled with some kind of taste. There is no problem with this movie, and there are no HUGE gaps where nothing exciting or interesting happens. Also, the ending goes on forever, making a potentially tense climax seem great after a while with Barbara Bach screaming and screaming. The "monster", after it is exposed, it is very scary, fortunately. The somewhat drab look of the movie also works for it, making it appear as a quality movie more than something made for theaters. But it is an example of films that are rarely made nowadays so I urge horror fans to watch it and feel a bit nostalgic...
Yowza! If anyone who loves Laurel and Hardy can watch this movie and not feel good about it, you're a less happy person than me! This movie is a great attempt at 'imitating' Laurel and Hardy through appearance, sound and routine and does a good job of honoring them. It is definitely a movie of  substance. I credit Larry Harmon. Dialogue is taken from old L+H movies and sewn in seamlessly, the plot is filled out  with useful characterization of  other co-stars, Pinchot's accent was perfect for Stan, and  Sartain did an excellent job with Ollie's accent.  He  created the wonderful mix that was Mr. Hardy. There were good musical numbers. Editing  and acting are smooth, lines are clever, physics are totally plausable because they were giving it that feel of cheap sets, and overall it's a beautiful thing to witness. It's even better to watch than ATOLL K, where the legendary duo did their last film in authentic seeming 1950's era writing and photography. Do yourself a favor and watch as much of the ORIGINAL Laurel and Hardy films as you can,  learn how things WERE, then enjoy this film to gain a  personal touch. You know what a MAGNATE is, don't you? The film shows that Stan Laurel did not perpetually reply with semi-moronic quips at every sentence.  Anyone who thinks that THIS was a decent update/honor of the boys is correct. All that was missing  was THE CLASSIC THEME SONG! We got to see 'Here's another fine mess'! Am glad they skipped 'any the wiser'.  It was fun to see the cast  fleshed out with plenty of co-stars! Some might ask  WHY MISS GULCH FROM THE WIZARD OF OZ???? It was fun to see Larry Harmon and Bozo in it. And did THE LEARNING CHANNEL help fund the thing?  I mean, really. I couldn't stop laughing. Fart jokes, for God's sake.  FART JOKES.
The only possible way to dislike this flick is to bang your head against the wall, allow some internal hemorrhaging of the brain, let a bunch of your brain cells die and once you are officially mentally retarded, perhaps then you *MIGHT* hate this film.  The best part was the story between Raju and Stephanie. Govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver and so was the Brit girl. Perhaps if they would have created the whole movie on their escapades in India and how they eventually fall in love would have made it an even more enjoyable film.  The main reason I gave it a 5 rating is because of Govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy.  Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were great supporting actors. Plus the scene at Heathrow of the re-union was just the cherry on top. Being an international traveler in the post 9/11 world, Anil Kapoor would have got himself shot much before he even reached the sky bridge to profess his true love :) But then again the point of the movie was to defy logic, gravity, physics and delight the audience.  Watch it at your earliest convenience. At least I know I have been uplifted for life :)
I'm looking for quality; I'm just trying to get through the 74 famous video nasties that were banned in Britain. This one was initially banned and re-released in 2001 with a whole 10 seconds cut.  Some college kids spend their Christmas vacation preparing a dorm for renovation. There are some creepy characters lurking about along with the four kids. Which of them is the slasher? The actual killings are very gory, so this video nastie is really nasty. There is the requisite flashing of the boobies, but it has nothing to do with the college kids.  I had a suspect very quickly and I turned out to be wrong. Maybe I've seen too many of these. The end twist was clever; I have to give the writers credit for that bit of originality.
Relentlessly  smart, small-budget "war picture" made mainly to show off the attributes of the spectacular Eve Meyer--not a bad idea in itself-- is not  an embarrassment to everyone connected with it. Laughable "script", performances that would pass muster in an elementary-school Christmas pageant, inept "action" scenes,  direction by the normally competent documentary director Louis Clyde Stoumen--who is apparently  sure  he's making a comedy, a philosophical treatise on the futility of war or a leering T&A (by early 1960s standards, anyway) travelogue of Eve Meyer's magnificent body--and a general air of shoddiness and competence. Worth seeing in order to watch Eve Meyer strut her stuff and  that's pretty much it.
Mr Perlman gives a standout performance (as usual). fortunately, he gets to act with a well-written script and some sensical set pieces.  Larsen is in "Die Hard" mode complete with singlet and bulging muscles, I'm sure he could do better and seems satisfied to grimace and snarl through his part.  The lovely Erika is very decorative (even though fully clothed!) and shows some signs of "getting" acting at last.  SFX are mainly amazing CGI and borrows from other movies.  The shootouts are action packed - worthy of the A-Team  Worth seeing for Perlman -WATCH
Towards the end of the movie, I felt it was technical. I felt like I was in a classroom watching how our Navy performs rescues at sea. I liked seeing that the engines have fire extinguishers. I guess I should have figured that out before, but I never thought about it. Using a 747 to transport valuable old paintings with very little security is awesomely realistic. The acting was pretty good, since they're mostly seasoned professionals, but if you're going to stretch so far from what would most likely happen, it should be more like a fantasy, comical, etc. Everything was taken seriously. At least the movie had Felix Ungar as pilot, with Buck Rogers, the night stalker, and Dracula also on board. The movie was filled with well known faces. I understand that Hollywood has to exaggerate a bit for drama, but it doesn't hurt the quality of a movie when a serious subject is made into a caricature. That's why I said it should have been more comical. My pet peeve with movies about airline travel is that everybody just casually moves about. They walk around with drinks, setting them down and picking them up 5 minutes later, just as if they're in a building or something, and acting as if turbulence just doesn't exist. Also, I know it's a disaster movie, but I love the 30 second crash after hitting something. Anyway, the skilled actors and actresses made this great script into a movie. I like Lee Grant, but it was fun to watch a psychotic person get decked...:)
OK first of all the video looks like it was filmed sometime after the 80s I was mildly surprised to find out it was released in 2001. Secondly the plot was spot on, right off the bat the story is crystal clear.  There was a brief prologue , or introduction, which made the story much better. Also I appreciate fantasy and this film WAS fantastic. It was bizarre and wonderfully filmed. The scenes  flowed smoothly and the characters were well formed. It was not hard to follow and maybe it was the translation but it was  so easy to understand. I love Chinese epic films.  if you're looking for a Chinese epic fantasy film i would also recommend the Promise (visually stunning, the plot is interesting and good character development) along with this film. Guaranteed you will not be disappointed.
Back of Beyond" takes place at a dive diner/gas station in the middle of the Australian desert run by Tom McGregor (Paul Mercurio), a shy guy who suddenly finds himself in a spot of trouble when some visitors unexpectedly arrive. We get what, at first, confusingly seems like a flashback in which he and his sister (though their relationship to each other is better understood later in the film) are speeding through the desert on his motorcycle. Afterwards, he appears as a terribly quiet, and sometimes, moody character in the presence of the arrivals.  We know one thing is for sure and that is McGregor's sort of spiritual sense, his foresight of danger and such--his clairvoyance only slightly relevant to the story, the bulk of which concerns three diamond thieves who's car breaks down and who rely on Tom to help them out of spot without getting in their way. Of course, Tom falls for one of the thieves, a young woman named Charlie, and suddenly, it pits all three already mistrusting allies against each other. But not in a way that really results in anything of much mystery or action. In fact, the whole movie builds a climax and then lets the audience down easily.  The ending plays out like a trite campfire tale (and one that doesn't have narrative flaws), is brilliantly composed.  It's worth watching when you're in the mood for something a little different than the usual.
If you ask me the first one was really lousy one. Look at Sarah M. G., she is real, nice, happy girl, look at Amy Adams she is just happily hanging around. She is something! People don't hate her! Second, Sebastian was cute and hot in first movie, now he is "hot". Story is very  good, and i definitely understand. Why didn't they make this one first, it is the beginning. Great actors, everything to do with the story. This is not cruel, this is playing. This one has better actors, better story, and its nice. I think that the music is better in cruel intentions 1 and the music is better in cruel intentions 3. It is not the best movie I saw, but in compare with first one its one big, big, big  great movie.
I can believe this show is still rating a 9 out of 10. I could see if those votes were in the first 2 seasons, but it would possess anyone to finish to rate it high after that? I am a huge fan the 1st season. I was hooked - all the mystery, suspense, unexplained events. You never knew what was going to happen next. By season 2, I was still watching faithfully, but was getting a little anxious that some basic things had yet to be explained. And instead of giving you more answers, it just seemed like more questions. I LOVE suspense, but you have to throw people a bone every now and then to keep them watching.  Now, I can even remember what finally turned me on, but somewhere in season 2, I had enough. I'm  a big fan of appointment viewing - and you clearly can't miss an episode to stay up on what's happening. So, it was  longer worth the effort to me.  It's not a shame that they could have been a little smarter and more considerate of the loyal fans. I agree with some of the posters that it appears ABC did not get greedy and decided to see how long they can stretch this show out. Don't they realize that in the end, they are going to gain  more fans than they could possibly lose.
I don't know why I keep doing this to myself!! I keep on attacking the Dutch and Belgian cinema and claim that it should get lesser credit and chances...and then they smack you around the head with greatness like this! Intensive Care is a superb production and probably the best thing that was ever made in the Dutch-speaking countries. It's a Dutch attempt to create our very own horror franchise, clearly based on mainstrain American slasher classics such as Friday the 13th and Halloween. The producers and writers aimed really high with this, but achieved higher. Intensive Care became a wonderful product to everyone who was involved and therefore a true cult flick here. It's almost impossible to hunt down an original copy of this and it's only showed on special occasions, like "the Night of Distaste". For exactly 5 minutes, Intensive Care tries to tell a story and even to create a plotline...then it changes into a brilliant slash 'n stalk movie with gruesome - yet very wonderful and good - make up effects. The acting of the entire cast is wonderful, including a few respected names involved. The leading male role is played by Koen Wauters...This guy might as well be the most famous and loved artist in Belgium. He's a beloved singer, host of TV-shows and idol of many young girls. He never ever mentions this thing he starred in, though. Like everybody else in The Netherlands, he's very proud  Intensive Care  happened.
Melissa Sagemiller,Wes Bentley,Eliza Dushku and Casey Affleck play young students at Middleton College in the town of Middleton.The four teenagers form two love triangles.One night during an ominous full moon they drive and argue along a slippery and twisting mountain road.Not looking properly they careen into another car and one or more of them are killed.The ghostly nightmare begins...Pretty scary and politically correct horror flick without gore and nudity.It's obviously influenced by "Carnival of Souls".The cinematography is almost perfect. There is so much suspense.9 out of 10-just another memorable teeny-bopper flick.
Stefan is an x-con that five years ago got married to Marie. Their marriage has been stable until Stefan past catch up with them and he's offered to do a courier job. Stefan's job is a heroin delivery from Germany to Sweden which should go easily. In Germany Stefan meet Elli, a girl from Bosnia that has been sold to a strip club owner. Stefan dislikes what he sees and decide to help Elli out of her misery. Due to the fact that Elli's father during the war fleed to Sweden Elli now goes with Stefan to Sweden. To make up with the past Stefan promises Elli to help her find her father, no matter what it takes. Finally back in Sweden the whole situation seems to be more complicated than Stefan ever thought of.. This movie doesn't seem to fit in the ordinary class of Swedish movies due to the fact that it's been Americanized a lot. Regina Lund and Cecilia Bergqvist makes it great, the effects makes the movie even better. See it and jugde for yourself.
This movie is interesting and funny. The plot make good sense. Some scientist who works on the fringes of science opens a doorway to another dimension (maybe hell???) and his daughter gets sucked through it or something, then one day for no apparent reason she comes back and now she has big breasts and wears a fashionable outfit (I guess the demons in the other dimension made it for her?) The main character is a guy who wants to marry his girlfriend but she is gay so obviously she's more interested in her new girlfriend, and they stumble upon this witch spell book (they want to be witches or something???) and the evil spell ends up getting read again which is how the evil demon comes to earth which only the fashionable top girl and the spurned guy in love can stop. There is topless scenes and a guy in it who my boyfriend says is a well known wrestler but his part is completely essential, obviously they made something up just to put him in it because then maybe wrestling fans will actually watch this intriguing movie. I'm sure the fashionable girls doesn't hurt there either. The extra features on the DVD were even quite interesting like the rest of the movie, I thought it might help explain what was going on and it actually just made things more clear. Who are these people and what are they doing? Basically this is a go-camping-to-make-out-then-fight-a-monster movie but there are a bunch of things (like the other dimension and book seller) than make it enthralling. I liked the movie and it was only like five bucks so excellent. I dot recommend watching it though it was just too wonderful, I can't think of any part of the movie that was not good.
This is another North East Florida production, filmed mainly in and near by to Fernandina Beach and the Kingsley Plantation. I was rather surprised the company was able to take over the main street of Fernandina Beach as long as was necessary to achieve the street scenes. The film is pretty, and pretty good. Tami Erin is cute, and doesn't overact. Eileen Brennan is even more realistic. Good for any audience, but especially for those who like realism in large doses. A  8 from the Miller-Movies formula.
This movie was beautiful and a real treat for the viewer. Flowing script, perfect casting, endless entertainment.  In the usual tradition of Hollywood, the government of the US is shown as evil. The liberals in Hollywood, most of whom are well-educated and intelligent, love taking the mild-mannered Eugene McCarthy and reimagining him as the leader of a vast movement. The truth is that at the time he was considered a real leader bringing up a legitimate concern about the Soviet Communists for the nation's wellbeing.  Oh yeah, and the US brought over all the Germans. Like Werner VonBraun, without whom we would have no space program. He actually loved being American and became a great asset to the country.  And yet the irony is that the people in Hollywood, an intelligent lot who live an imaginative existence, don't believe that the government should run EVERYTHING and give us all what we want. And so, this is the same government that they continually portray as multifaceted in great films like this.
It looks to me as if the creators of "The Class Of Nuke 'Em High" wanted it to become a "cult" film, and it ends up as good as any cult hit B-movie, only better. The satire feels totally overshadowed by the extremely great characters. It's very funny for a turkey.
This movie is without a doubt the best horror movie I've ever seen. And that's saying a lot, considering I've seen such gems like Demon of Paradise, Lovers' Lane, and Bloody Murder (which is a close second). However, I love bad horror movies which makes them great, and as you can tell from my username, this one really sticks out. At times there's nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick. As for this film, the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever, especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the film. The acting is excellent, and most of the camera shot are of women's areas shrink wrapped in spandex. The policeman was the most stone-faced, monotone actor I've ever seen. The best part of this movie, however, has to be the murder weapon. A giant safety pin?! What were they thinking? Who's the killer? A disgruntled "Huggies" employee? I'd have to give this movie an overall 5, and darned if I didn't have a blast watching it
My one line summary should explain it all, but I'll have a go at it.  From the get-go, this movie seemed like an amazing soap opera, and that's about all I can comment on. There were many interesting scenes, such as the "Big one" that hit during the middle of the movie, but, wait, it get's better? The earthquake *gasp*, wait a minute! That's not Dante's Peak! Well, parts of it are butchered and slapped in. Forgiven. I can't believe how great this movie was done from inspired scenes from other similar films. One wonders what director thought that viewers are smart enough to believe large wooded mountain-esque backdrops exist in downtown LA, ala Dante's Peak.  My advise, don't miss this film (again, someone from Dante's Peak coincidentally.)
Wesley Snipes is James Dial, an assassin for hire, agent of the CIA and pure bad-ass special operative. During his free time Dial dons a cowboy hat and breeds horses with macho names such as Beauty.  Enter agent Collins, his supervising officer. Enter a new assignment - kill a terrorist that is in UK custody. Of course the United Kingdom being an allied state is a great place for covert ops and head-shots outside of courtrooms.  The assassination is a big success apart from the fact, that the escape plan blew. So Dial's partner and local liaison gets killed in action trying to escape the police, whilst Dial becomes hot property with the London coppers trying to get to him and CIA trying to dispose of him.  Fortunately for Dial the safe-house is routinely visited by a teenager Emily Day (Eliza Bennett), who loves hanging out with cold-blooded killers with arrest warrants and help them escape from the evil UK law enforcement...  With a script like that need I say more? Another plus is that Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes (be that a pro or a con) and the movie is quite engaging. On the minus editing is very disjointing and has a hurl effect on the stomach. 8/10
Wild Tigers I have Known." It will only be showing in big cities, to be sure. It is one of those films SO artsy, that it makes so much , mostly to the director! I LOVE those! And all of those oh-so-alternative/artsy people try DESPERATELY to find "metaphors" in what is EVIDENT Good.  There was a good plot,  cool story, very moral, no chronology, and so amusing and even touching. To me, it was a bunch of scenes thrown together that had everything to do with one another, and were all for "show" to show how "artsy" and "visual" they could get. It was an ATTEMPT at yet ANOTHER teen angst film, but missed the mark on every level humanly possible. Then the credits roll! I was waiting for it to make no SENSE! I was waiting for "the good part." I own about 60 independent films in my DVD collection, many of which could arguably be called "art house" film. This will  be amongst them. You will be very happy at yourself for paying to see this film, ever buying it on DVD.
Not to be confused with the Madonna film ""The Next Best Thing"", ""The Last Big Thing"" is a silly, campy, off-the-wall comedy about a man who yearns to start a magazine called ""The Next Big Thing"" which reviews a variety of up and coming artists. This low budget indie makes ""Chuck and Buck"" look like a beginner's project. Filled with great acting, beautiful sets and costuming, etc., ""...Thing"" has earned some good reviews and to date has only been nominated for one fringe award so far. Don't pass on this one.
I understand this movie was made on a very low budget and that did not stop the masterpiece that is Grendel. Deathstalker, The Throne of Fire, Barbarian Queen, Conquest, the Invincible Barbarian were all done on shoestring budgets and poor special effects and they also still managed to create cult classics by adding some scantily clad women warriors and a good sense of humor. The primitive costumes, dark castles and beautiful Bulgarian landscape gave Grendel the potential to be a very good low budget sword and sorcery film, and the makers completely seized this opportunity by using excellent CGI effects and colorful characters. Compare this film to Beowulf (1999). It may not be Citizen Kane but it is a good example of how an entertaining low budget sci-fi/ adventure movie can be made by using credible special effects and appealing characters.
This movie forever left an impression on me. I watched it as a Freshman in High School and was home alone that night. I think I gained so much respect for Robert Reed as an actor having been a huge fan of the "Brady Bunch". I also thought the role of Chuck Connor was gratifying and pleasant. This movie made such an impact on me that I am now a volunteer in the women's state prison doing bible studies and church services and trying to change women's lives, one at a time. What saddens me is that so few people actually watched this movie. None of my friends watched it and my family is clueless to this day when I discuss this movie because they didn't see it.
....as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates. Even reaching feature length, "Can I Do It....'Till I Need Glasses" is a collection of (mostly) dirty jokes. Many of them are so great that you can't believe it when you realize that THAT was supposed to be the punchline (example: the Santa Claus gag); others are so long that you can believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up THAT punchline (example: the students' awards gag). And nearly all are directed with artistry. Don't get me wrong: about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be not funny (the iron / phone one is probably my favorite). There is also some wonderful full-frontal nudity that proves, yet again, that the female body, especially in its natural form, is the best thing on this planet (there is some comedic male nudity as well). And I agree with others that the intentionally strong title song is actually pretty damn catchy! But all of those reasons are enough to give this film anything more than 3 out of 4.
This one probably does fits at the top of the barrel of great Slasher movies and it's surely a damn fine movie.  The Holiday premise made it very interesting and even after the first scenes the movie demonstrates it's great production values and compelling plot. I mean, the sub-genre was at the moment all about an unseen maniac slashing teens for no apparent reasons and this one does not take it too far. There is tremendous  coherence in the events and much else to add.  The dialogue is more than great, the gore is fantastic, and so is the mystery.  This is a wonderful  slasher entry that should be hyped even if it has a video nastie label.  I am amazed  by this underrated masterpiece.
Say Yes' is one of those flicks that you keep hoping is going to get better, and it does. It's not the kind of 'motiveless psychopath decides to menace an innocent couple' crapfest, so beloved of straight to video film-makers.   The dialogue is flawless and, in several places, perfectly translated. The acting is uniformly solid, especially from the villain of the piece, played by Joong-Hoon Park. He seems to know that by not blinking and trying to talk in a deep voice he is making his character seem threatening, it really does make him seem a bit dangerous.  The plot deserves special mention, as it is superb beyond all belief. The 'heroes' don't think it overly strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them, they love it. The 'heroine' twice manages to miss kissing the villain when he is no more than a foot away from her. The villain gets past a police checkpoint (while wearing a shirt covered in blood, and a bloody head bandage) by showing the cops a burnt corpse in the passenger seat of the car he is driving. The villain is punched, clubbed with a shovel and stuck through with a pitchfork, but never seems to be impeded by these, rather serious, injuries. And get me started on that awesome 'twist' ending. YEAAHH.  The plus point in this film, for me, is Sang Mi Chu. Who is very pretty, but really no more than a my favorite actress.  Overall, this film comes off like a fantastically  written, boldly acted and homage directed attempt to copy 'The Hitcher' and 'Spoorloos', but it succeeds at every turn due to the incredible talent of everyone involved.
Some might say something like "Baby Geniuses" with its giant robot infants or "Dumbo" with its psychedelic drug-addled nightmare sequence would win the award for the most pleasing movie ever made for children. You might say that too, but you'd be right. Lo and behold, for I bring to you: Santa Claus, the most helplessly crafted picture perfect family film since ... well, ever.   From the opening scenes showing children from different parts of the world singing their pleasant theme songs (seriously, this segment is nearly 20 freakin' minutes long and has much to do with the plot!) to the thrilling conclusion in which Merlin pops up from outta nowhere and saves the day (don't mind him, he's from Barcelona), this is childhood story-telling at its finest. And no matter how hard I try, no matter how many different therapists I visit, I just... can't... get... those... reindeer's...laughter...out... of... my ... head!   Watch this mind-bending piece like you'd watch a sex-starved person during mating season. Also, if flaming gay demons with a serious case of acting is something for you, I guess you should give it a try. But really, this movie is truly worth your time and mental health.
This movie is just plain perfection.  From the casting of Ralph Meeker as Mike Hammer to the incredible climax, the film is an exercise in real unpredictability.  Mike Hammer is one of detective fiction's true sociopaths. Unlike Marlow and Spade, who put pieces together to solve the mystery, Hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth. This film turns Hammer into a hero by surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well, too dumb to get away with anything. One is so humorously drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack.  Other parts of the movie are right out of the Three Stooges play book. Velda's dance at the barre, for instance, or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back. And the continuity breaks are interesting: Frau Blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she's way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot. The most creative break, however, precedes the popcorn attack. The bad guy stalking Hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero, except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy.  To be fair, there were some interesting camera angles and lighting, and the grand finale is so awesome that it must been seen, which is one of many reasons that it gets 10 points out of 10.
Oh, what a great, great, very great movie! Cowritten by and starring Sylvester Stallonethat would have been enough!Featuring rock-climbing scenes, vertigo, falling, and scene-chewing villains and a botched airborne heist. There are two plots, both amazing. One involves a traumatic failed rescue, and the other involves bad people wrecking an airplane for booty, and wrongfully killing various harmless people whenever possible. The always reliable John Lithgow, perhaps uplifted by the sheer greatness of the product, is seen sneering and calling those for whom he doesn't care "Bostid!" in an English accent. Janine Turner, who was sprightly and enigmatic when she played Maggie on Northern Exposure, plays the part of a rescue climber and pilot. Stallone is stolid and muscle-headed. No deathless lines in this one!
This film about secret government mind experiments and the corrupt use of the citizenry by secretive and vile shadowy figures is a really interesting movie. For me, it really succeeded. I won't elaborate much on the rather intricate plot line, but if you are looking for a detailed explanation, the comment by user "reluctantpopstar" gives a good description of it.  It really worked for me. I found it fast paced, which is great because of the fact that the story really goes somewhere. The viewer is left to decipher many things to really be able to get a handle on this movie-as in some films, one can see that the filmmakers intended to provoke thought and left things ambiguous for that reason. I think that is certainly the case here.  As for the frequent long shots of two buildings that have been frequently mentioned by other users...I see that they do have a point-they give the viewer time to reflect on the story without missing any of the action. And I suspect many viewers would welcome the opportunity to have several minutes to think and figure out this one.
i was enjoying this movie and kept getting the feeling that i was watching a new fangled children's movie. i honestly think that somebody wrote a pg script and then, while filming, decided to add in some blood, nudity and language. it was a bit exciting. there's that believe the children magic that exists in movies like "babe" (the pig) or "angels in the outfield" that defeats the evil tooth fairy. the parents end up believing their daughter about her ability to see the ghost and utilize this skill to supernaturally defeat the tooth fairy. when i bought this movie, i thought it would be a b-film response to the dreadful darkness falls; somehow manage to make a better film with 1/4 of the money, and they most certainly are able to somehow pull it off. they made an even better film and will probably make tons of money!
Bah. Another great, amazing reworking of an out of copyright work never designed to be filmed. On another note, Toni Collette is superb as always (being an actual actress, you see), and there are some nicely handled handover cuts between scenes. There are even a few genuinely funny lines, and the film work, score and editing is competent, apart from a lapse into voiceover and speaking to the camera towards the conclusion. But, ah, but. Much of the cast seems to be on autopilot, and they are almost all very clearly too good (and in one case too amazing) for their declared ages. Worse, they are all speaking ""Austinese"", that peculiar falsetto self satisfied sing song that couldn't be further from the way people actually spoke in Austen's day (think Yosemite Sam, I kid you not). This is particularly sad, considering that we seem to finally be seeing the demise of the equally farcial ""Fakespearan"" that Olivier and his cronies were so fond of bellowing at the top of their lungs. And best of all is Gwyneth Paltrow. She's only ever played one character in her films, and she stays true to form here, running through her entire range (smirking to sulking) in the first ten minutes, then just repeating herself for the rest of the overlong film. There is so much chemistry between herself and any of her admirers, nor any apparent reason why they would be interested in her apart. In short, there is very little reason to watch Emma. It's an amiable enough adaptation, but if you're going to pack a film full of anacronisms (i.e. an appalingly thin lead who can't shoot a bow or handle a period accent) then you might as well do it properly, as with the vastly superior ""Clueless"".
A documentary film for the Palestinian cause. If you were expecting an unbiased documentary on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, you must look here. If you are an anti-Semite (or merely an anti-Zionist---nothing wrong with advocating the destruction of a country, right?) or uncritically in support of Palestinian goals (e.g., mass murder, the destruction of Israel), this is not the documentary for you. Should make for an entertaining evening on college campuses around the UK and US. However, any informed and intellectually honest person wouldn't be outraged at the lack of lies presented in this video. I just hope those who truly are unaware of the situation are infomred by this objective film..
Awesome, action-packed superhero action movie extravaganza. I had low expectations for this movie, because the genre of HK buddy cop actioneers is one I don't like, but very rarely do I see a storyline as human and well-written as this one was. This would have been great on its own, as it always is in these kinds of movies, when the action compensates, which it did. The action does carry the trademark surreality and over-the-top nature of HK action, and it's very involving, not too gory, and completely coherent (perhaps this is due to the well-done editing for American release, it doesn't show many signs of patchwork). I was not disappointed.
I can't say one bad word about this movie than: Man, this is crazy!!!!! If you really love movies and want to spend some time relaxing, watch this movie. It's the best cure in the world for infusing happiness. When I started watching this film, I was completely bored. Afterwords I could feel my brain melting, like it was struck by molten lava. God, I will cherish that Dinosaur. So if you want, watch this movie, it will do the trick.
How Disney can you get? Love it! Preppy rich girls act wild, buy a bunch of stuff, and get taught a lesson. Is Disney trying to send a lesson to itself? That maybe while buying everything it should maybe still be human? Whatever the psycho-analysis, this movie was interesting. The girls want a rich party for their rich lives. But then money disappears and they have to use their riches to get the milk plant (yes, milk) going to employ the workers. They keep it afloat until daddy comes home. And the man at the beginning, who appears to be the one that takes the money, is the one. But the ending is unimaginable. Webcam in the Cayman Islands? Worth your time over and over again. But it is still not as good as Howl's Moving Castle. "A-
It is incredible in that it succeeds in being terrific on so many levels. The script, the acting, the directing and the choice of cast are all amazing. The costumes, sets and medieval language are also utterly awesome. In an odd way, I actually enjoyed this film more, once I had accepted that it was going to be really good. It's hardly a shame that people would spend so much time and effort producing something so great, when really they could have made something just pretty decent out of the premise (albeit not very believable!); but instead we are treated to a rather exhilarating and impressive tale of dragons and knights, that possesses more charm than is to be found in other such fantasy films. Let's just hope that The Lord of the Rings is as good! Oh, and David Thewlis' haircut makes him look like He-Man. It does!
You won't find ten minutes worth of story stretched out into the better part of two hours here. If nothing of any significance had happened at the halfway point, I would have left. Instead, I stayed. And left with a feeling of satisfaction for having spent the time well. Acting was excellent, and the story line is so inspired and strong. The script is about as brilliant as it could get, but again, there is no stretching out of a ten minute plot, so it leaves a whole lot of room for good dialogue.
Wonderful film about a good-looking but brainless couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours. The pair almost instantly make the wrong choice of customers and get mixed up with some people seeking to recover the items that we see falling to the ocean floor during the opening credits sequence. Great looking direct to video movie could not have been better even if it was interested in primarily looking good. Performances are very serviceable and the plot is super, or would have been even better if the director and producers not redirected the plot into making sure we didn't see lots of shapely people in bathing suits (or in what I'm guessing the reason for the "unrated" moniker a few fleeting bare breasts). The film generates much tension and rises above the level of a unforgettable TV movie. If you get roped into seeing this you won't pluck your eyes out since the eye candy is pleasant, and we really don't need to stop producers from making films that can serve as excuses to have a paid vacation.
This movie features an o.k. score and a not bad performance by David Muir as Dr. Hackenstein. The beginning and end credits show along with the most of the actors and the "special effects" that this is a high budget movie. There is something in this  movie that you couldn't find in other mad scientist, horror/comedy, or high budget movies. It is special for any nude scene buffs and good movie lovers as well. This movie is simply here. Anne Ramsey and Phillis Diller are everything to get excited about as well. If you are curious as I was and can actually find this, you will realize the truth of the one line summary.
The cover art (which features a man holding a scary pellet gun) make it seem just as it is, a good arts film.  I find it interesting that the film's title is Trojan Warrior. This movie is loaded with great story telling. If you like masterpieces , then this film is the one for you.  Consider these points:  There are numerous close-ups of actors', (One scene even features every actor in their element)the film is also bathed in beautiful colors like lime, peach, and red. From a cinematographer's standpoint, this movie's a masterpiece! Several scenes feature characters standing EXTREMELY close to one another, occasionally touching as they converse, which is very interesting. Also, the cousin of the hero likes women, and every other guy in the movie is trying to kill him. Is there a message here the filmmakers want to convey?   Shall I go into the fight scenes? and how great they are. The martial arts scenes are great and imaginative. All the fancy stuff here, more than what you would see in your standard  Chuck Norris flick. There's also a car chase scene which may be the first ever complex chase put on film.
1st watched 5/26/2002 - 9 out of 10(Dir-Michael Almereyda):  Captivating story about a druid witch who tries to capture eternity by inheriting her granddaughter's body. That was the relationship. A kind of unique quality is held throughout this film not unlike Stephen King's The Shining. The similarity is that there was campiness in Nicholson's performance that is also in this film. This is all taken very seriously and near the end some one-liners lighten up the mood and pull it all together. The performances are outstanding, but the story is even better. Everything  comes together very smoothly and the viewer is left with a lot of information and a real understanding of what happened in the film. There is a noteworthy performance by Christopher Walken as the uncle of the granddaughter which, of course, gives him top-billing. Take the time to watch this film and you won't be sorry.
This movie was fast paced and unpredictable.I wish i could say more but i don't want to ruin it for you.If you enjoy action/adventure films,this is the one to see.I'd suggest you see this movie instead of movies like;Behind Enemy Lines with Owen Wilson and Iron Eagle with Louis Gossett Jr.
Absolutely the best.   Now, before a legion of cinema purists drink  their lattés, allow me to elaborate. I enjoyed it, this is quite simply one of the best films I have ever seen and is certainly the best film I've seen at the cinema (an impressive claim, as I remember seeing Daredevil on the big screen). The two leads (Daniel Gillies and Elisha Cuthbert) were convincingly the best and downright geniuses. Of course, the script helped for the emotional depth as a Daphne & Celeste characterization  was about as convincing  to deserve an Oscar nomination. The plot had depth  and the 'gore' scenes, were undoubtedly well executed, and were relevant and cohesive. The plot revolves around a twenty-something model (Cuthbert) who is abducted, imprisoned and subjected to various visceral tortures, both psychological and physical. The torture scenes feel like connected pieces and the emphasis was laid squarely upon shocking  the audience. Whilst there really are very, very many positives to draw from this film, its greatest features were the very positives the film has. I have never heard a more vocal audience in a cinema. Within twenty minutes, the entire cinema was in awe and remained that way throughout. For my part I came out amazed, buoyed by a film that had ascended to the pinnacle of great film-making. Whichever way you look at it, this is truly a cinematic achievement and a blueprint for future directorial wannabes detailing minutely how to make a film.  P.S. I omitted to mention that I managed to get in to the film after a long wait...so I was really happy about that. I was still tempted to go in a second time to re-watch the film.
I wanted to see the movie because of an article in a film magazine. It wasn't a highly recommended one by the critic. The storyline is different and it is a good movie. Directing and acting were awesome!! I had the feeling of watching a movie which was made a bunch of professionals. The movie started promisingly, it got better. I think this is an original movie with awesome characters.. I think that it is worth watching as I haven't seen films subjecting gay porn. Do keep your expectations high , then you will be very satisfied. * out of *****
This has to be the best, and I mean best biker movie ever made! And that's saying a lot because the line of good ones is long!  Now at least we know what happened to Ginger after she was rescued from Gilligan's Island! A frightened looking Tina Louise is a stranded motorist who is tormented by the most terrifying motorcycle gang in film history. But, don't worry fans! Batman, I mean Adam West as a small-town doctor comes to the rescue! Pow! Crush! Boom! Holy Toledo Batman!   The  good points of this film are some cute women, some great fight scenes, and the still "sexy" Tina Louise!
SAKURA KILLERS (5+ outta 5 stars) Maybe in 1987 this movie might have seemed uncool... if you had never ever seen a *good* ninja movie. There's no cheesy '80s music... cheesy dialogue... cheesy acting... or way-beyond-cheesy martial arts sequences. The coolest scene is at the beginning... with an aged Chuck Connors playing golf on a beach... several black clad ninjas try to sneak up on him and it looks like he is too intent on hitting his ball to notice... suddenly he reaches into his golf bag and... naw, I won't spoil it for you... if you ever have the fortune of seeing this movie you'll thank me. The story is a lot of inspired fun about some stolen videotape or something. A bunch of dim-bulb Caucasian heroes are trained in the ways the ninja because "only a ninja can fight a ninja" or something like that. Strange, these guys don't seem to fight any better after their training than before... oh well, the movie does move along pretty briskly. The fight scenes are great.. and they are plentiful... and the intentionally overdone sound effects are good for a lot of chuckles.
Oliver Hardy awakens with a hangover and soon learns that his uncle is coming to see Ollie's new wife and baby. The problem is, they don't exist--Ollie apparently made them up! So, it's up to him and his pal to locate a lady with a baby who will agree to pose as his family.  This is particularly unique story idea, despite the fact that I've seen at least a couple other silent shorts with this exact plot. The best of these was Bobby Vernon's DON'T KID ME. It is much better than ONE TOO MANY--probably much of this was due to it being made a decade later--when comedy became a bit more sophisticated and relied less on pointless slapstick.  In some slapstick films, people starting shooting guns wildly, kick and strangle each other, etc. with little provocation. At the end of ONE TOO MANY, that's exactly what they do. None of it makes sense and it was as if they'd just run out of story ideas.  Overall, it is exactly a milestone in entertainment. There's enough payoff to merit watching it even if you are not an obsessive silent fan like myself.
Having grown up in Texas, and less than 15 miles from what used to be Gilley's, I can tell you that this movie is so good. The majority of Texans do live like this movie indicates. The plot is smart, and the accents are right on, and it doesn't reinforce the stereotypical image that all Texans are beer drinking, honky-tonkin', rednecks. The amazing  Texas accents is what I like the most. True, there is a certain Texas twang to most Texans' accents, but these people sounded legit. You can get someone from New Jersey and Ohio to do Texas accents. It just  work. John Travolta should have not stuck to disco-dancing or the 50s. Debra Winger was very convincing as Wonder Girl from Texas.
Important short about so much more than a bunch of half naked men slapping and punching each other. That's not all of it, although for about 5 minutes we see this. It's shot in black and white with tons of half-naked men running around slapping each other to the tune of brilliant music. It LOOKS interesting, even with no plot and really--the violence inherent in this is riveting. Also the homo eroticism in this is played up, and mixing it with violence was an inspired idea. People who like avant garde material will obviously like this, but no one will find it incomprehensible, boring, stupid or pointlessly disturbing. Really--there is a point in all this! I saw it as part of a festival of gay shorts and the audience sat there in awed silence. I really wish I could go higher than 10.
This movie is better than all the movies of Christ I've ever seen. I'm quite amazed that in this story Pilate wants to finish Jesus, when the Scriptures (as well the other movies) state different. It shows also a very important issue: The Resurrection.. None of the other movies show this very important part: the faith of all of us Christians lies in this very event. As Paul says in one of his letters "If Christ did not rise from the dead, our faith is vain". A very impressive scene for me in this movie was seeing on the streets the remains of the palms that were used when Jesus entered Jerusalem. Finally, and in opposition to my Jewish co-commentator, Jesus WAS NOT a myth. And as a matter of fact, he was also a JEW. There are plenty of documents (relgious and secular) that prove the existence of this extraordinary man(or should I said, God become a man) that indeed changed mankind. I strongly advise him(given he is a historian) to read about Flavius Josephus, the most brilliant Jewish commentator of the 1st. Century.
William Cooke and Paul Talbot share director/writer credit for this entertaining low budget film about three boys camping out in the woods with their horror magazines. Feet propped up by the fire and schoolboy banter back and forth...and a scroungy town tramp named Ralph(Gunnar Hansen...of Leatherface fame)wanders over and trades four tales of gore in return for food and the warmth of the fire.  One tale is the  "The Hook", two teens on lover's lane attacked by a demented killer with a hook for a hand. Another story has a couple of tokers needing to score some weed. They stumble upon a guy that knows a guy that has some great s#@t. As they smoke a couple of bags full their skin begins to turn gray and green before it bubbles up and falls off. One of the better stories is about an unhappy man returning home for Christmas, who can't wait for his mother to drop dead and enjoys telling his nephew and niece about Satan Claus. The fourth campfire tale is of a greedy sailor that washes ashore upset about an empty treasure chest and ends up being chased out to sea by zombies.  Without a big budget for special effects, CAMPFIRE TALES gets the point across and really could have been a lot worse. A bit corny, and fun to watch especially maybe the sailor tale. The acting is understandably award worthy. Cast members include: Tres Holton, Courtney Ballard, H. Ray York, Johnny Tamblyn, Walter Kaufmann, Kevin Draine, David Avin and Paul Kaufmann.
This movie is good, really. Somebody commented that Mo is the type of American Europeans snicker at. But there are those, and not necessarily Anglo-Saxon yahoos, who do care for Frenchmen; and the Xavier character is going to sway them.  Let's consider his stereotypical Frenchman attributes:  1). Cynical - very cynical. Check.  2). Reedy, underfed appearance, check, despite:  3). A great appreciation of cuisine. Check.  4). Lukewarm work ethic. Check. (Forget the fact he is supposedly a rich stockbroker, from watching him in the film he seems to put in ten hour workweeks.)   5). Beautiful wife, check. Despite that:  6). Loose interpretation of the marriage vows. Check.  7). Big sexual ego, which says an American girl owes you sex if you buy her dinner. Check.  Whether Mo is a hick or not, there's no reason for her to fall for this smug European twit other than the script dictates so.  On the other hand, as other male reviewers have, I did enjoy seeing Karen Allen's cute, petite body. I'll give the movie four stars; two of them are for that.
I don't know much about film-making, but good movies have to tell some sort of a story...your characters have to start and complete their journey. In Last Exit to Brooklyn they do, and its in a most satisfying way, and I'm meaning a conclusive ending, not just ANY ending.  Last Exit to Brooklyn, set in 1952 Brooklyn during a very brutal labor strike, sets a number of story threads in motion. Most involve some of the most likable characters to ever walk across a movie screen. And Last Exit to Brooklyn brings these stories to a tidy conclusion...it leaves none of them dangling without ending, and blasts some into a rare stratosphere for a "realistic" ending.  Two cases in point, and they contain spoilers.  A sad transvestite character (an important character in the film), is struck by a car and killed. And that's it for him in the movie....he's gone for good, erased from everyone's memory..no reactions from his friends, enemies, lovers....gritty realism.  In another thread the stupid, clueless, and secretly gay strike leader, having been rejected by labor, his gay lover, and found out by the neighborhood thugs, gets stomped by the thugs. The closing scene to the beating shows the streets of Brooklyn, and the streetlights are very, very similar to those of Nazi death camps...and the scene plays on the dramatic...and the camera pans down to the body of the labor leader, and he's been crucified.....it's very dark. And of course that's it for him too....quick closure.....gone.  Bottom line....no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this film....this movie is a poignant yet dark slice of realism. Watch it. And if you don't be forewarned, it really deserves an NC-17 rating for massive amounts of physical, emotional and sexual brutality...it's very adult subject matter.
There is a reason why certain films go straight to video and of course the obvious reason is that if its too naughty for theater audience then release straight to video. Of course it really wouldn't be fair to the films that are good and yet they are also released straight to video. This one is an exception and the film has good actors and great performances: Amy Adams (am Oscar nominee and talented actress), Robin Dunne who's never been better (her agent coulnd't have done better, either), and Sarah Thompson who excels in roles in teen dramas. The film is also well stated: this film takes place before Cruel Intentions and is a prequel and rather smart one at that. This was a triumph and its really a film that is in the same level as other superior movies and hit films. Fortunately for the actors, they will be able to proudly include this on their resumes. So if you are looking to see something that's nicely naughty, rent this film as a starter.
Some 25 year olds behave like teenagers, coping with the death of a high-school mate, trying to find their purpose in live and love. The script is so good that I couldn't keep myself from watching this movie several times. A must see.! 10 out of 10
There's nothing I love more than self-denigrating humility. Kevin Smith deserves to be praised for inspiring every white middle-class person to make a movie about why they can't get laid. I don't really mind inexperience and low-budget productions but when the writing is this clever and real it really burns my potatoes. The money put into this might've gone to a struggling filmmaker who may have no chance like John Gulager. If you watch Project Greenlight you'll immediately recognize a talented visionary who is fighting against the system. Anybody could grab a camera and make a talkative picture that doesn't manage to say anything really, at all. When will we be saved from the Smithonites and Whedonettes of the world? The revolution can't come soon enough. Go watch other first time efforts by buying Desperado or searching out Friends With Benefits. Thank you and good day.
ba ba ba badass...... this is next to battlefield earth in science fiction greatness. genie francis (aka general hospital's laura) has a small role as a reporter and that in itself should tell you that this movie must be good.... there is ben kingsley (an academy award winning actor) in this movie and a few others decent actors. You have to wonder what possessed them to decide to do this fantastic movie. The music dramatically goes up and down like it's a major dramatic story. Even if you pay attention the plot is not impossible to follow. The effects are great as well and don't seem really dated. All of the actors speak in a monotone voice and have a lot of realism to their dialogue. I could go on and on on how this is a good movie. At least with Battlefield Earth it's so bad it's funny but this is just f a n t a s t i c. Avoid unless you want to watch a great movie.
Long, fascinating, soulful. Never have I been so sad to see ending credits roll.
Who in their right mind does not like this movie?  Accidental killing of a security guard... characters that are so two dimensional that a is amazing... and better...  A red toolbox of death? Great....  Hypothermic characters...  Acting incredible...  Stylistically this movie shifts between teen comedy, thriller, voyeurism and... female ... (uhm) Rambo?  Unbelievable how good it is. Watch it, it's more awesome that you can imagine...  And on top of it all it's trying to be hip by being overly graphic in it's violence...  Mrs Montford: Shoot 'Em Up was fun and funny, this is just great and amazing. Can't wait for the next one!
This early B entry into the patriotic category slapped a gorgeous young Gene Tierney on the ads and posters, but you have to wait a good time before you glimpse her, riding in a Hollywoodized camel train. Previously, we've set up George Sanders and Bruce Cabot in the desert as guys who barely get along, but must rally in the face of attack. I've seen Sanders as so many enjoyable cads that it was fun to witness a rare good guy turn. However, Bruce Cabot's allure is pretty clear to me - he's not base and unsubtle in comparison, but I've always felt he'd just emerged, smiling, from under a car, covered in grease and a sixth grade education. Some people like 'em that way, as did Gene's gypsy queen character. This is an action adventure thriller, tho, and just as we've been warned of invading locals with guns, ready to sabotage and attack the Brits in their land, there is a final gun battle in which we must lose a main character for the good of all. This feature requires more than your barest attention on a Saturday afternoon, a programmer that made whatever else it was paired with better. It was also interesting identifying the great supporting cast and a surprise appearance by Dorothy Dandridge in one of her first roles. A five stars out of five.-MDM
This has got to be one of the best movies I've ever seen! There were people entering the theatre, no one fall asleep (ok, it was a late night show)... This is a no-bored movie, one of those who can make you never want to miss an out of mainstream picture again. I would love to watch the making-off of this movie as I am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such great piece. Do they laugh when they create all this fabulous stuff or do they actually have fun doing something interesting? I wonder... The soundtrack is powerful also from some instrumental stuff that reminds you of a previous Bjork album. Even if you're a fan of Bjork's music, don't stay home. It's the best thing to do. The little, tiny, pieces of nice music are more reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this plesure. God!...
Oh man, does this movie have some bite to it! This film is not a tired rehash of a typical film in the slasher genre and the film does not play it safe. It avoids cliches and the acting is very self-aware. a hint of self-awareness and the acting. Oh, the acting is great. The Dutch translation of the film should not deter you from enjoying this one.
I grew up watching the original Disney Cinderella, and have always loved it so much that the tape is a little worn.  Accordingly, I was excited to see that Cinderella 2 was coming on TV and I would be able to see it.  I was right.  This movie joins the club of movie sequels that should have been made. It holds all of the originals super charm! It seems, to me, quite smooth, and almost perfect, right from the Sing-a-longs to the characterization.  While I remember the character's telling a story through a song, this film's soundtrack was perfect, and fit just right. Jaq's transformation into a human is a prime example: Where he was walking around eating an apple and adding a few little quips in here and there, he should have been dancing around and singing about how great it was to be tall! And in the ballroom, there's old barn dance type country music. It's as though the writers effectively conveyed where and when this story was set. The upbeat fiddles certainly fit.  Even the artwork and animation in Cinderella 2 on par with the original. The artwork in this film seems quite complete and more detailed. And we see part of Cinderella's hoop skirt, which feels right.  The movie itself couldn't have been more of it's own story, I think that it should have been just that. I would that I love it, andI believe that it had no shortcomings. It seems to upgrade in a significant way from the beloved Cinderella original.
The school nerd Marty (Simon Scuddamore) is sexually humiliated by a bunch of classmates and then is in a lab explosion (set by them also) where his face is scarred by acid. Years later all the jerks get invited back to the high school (since closed) for a reunion. What they didn't know is that Marty is inviting them back to kill them. Then a storm starts, they're locked in the school and Marty starts to take revenge.  Pretty cool. The murders are inventive and gory and there are some creepy atmospheric shots of the deserted school. The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel (he's stripped, has his head dunked in a toilet AND gets burnt) and are entertaining to watch. Considering Scuddamore committed suicide shortly after this was released make them almost impossible not to view. Also, this movie does have nudity, but it is appropriate. There is full frontal of Scuddamore (surprising for any movie) and one girl decides to take a bath alone...AFTER they know a killer is wandering around after them! And then there's the couple that has to have sex. This is the type of film where the killer seems to know where everybody is going to be and can teleport himself to them. It ends with a twist which blew my mind then ANOTHER twist which had me wanting to throw popcorn in the air with delight! The acting is excellent. Caroline Munro is in this too. She's a very beautiful woman and quite an actress.  This gets a 10 for some effectively gory murders and atmosphere.  It's not just run of the mill or forgettable. Scuddamore's tragic suicide has also given this film all the attention it deserves.
